            <h2>Vote.gov</h2>
            <p>Vote.gov makes it easier for eligible voters to participate in our democratic process by providing
                streamlined information on how to vote. Visitors can register electronically in states that allow it,
                and download a printable application in multiple languages for those states where electronic
                registration isn't an option. Vote.gov was ranked as the <a
                        href="{{ '/assets/documents/2017-benchmarking-us-government-websites.pdf' | url }}">#1 federal
                    website in 2017</a> by the Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation for meeting basic
                standards in security, speed, mobile friendliness, and accessibility.</p>

            <h2>Department of the Interior</h2>
            <p>The Department of the Interior's Natural Resources Revenue site provides data about how the government
                manages federal energy and mineral resources, revenue, and disbursements. The website delivers valuable
                data to policy experts, while also ensuring the general public can follow along through an intuitive
                user interface and contextual information. This is an excellent example of how Pages can be used to
                manage complex data sets and visualizations. You can learn more about <a

            <h2>College Scorecard</h2>
            <p>The Department of Education uses Pages to host College Scorecard, a website that provides users with
                important information on everything from financial aid to expected earnings. College Scorecard
                demonstrates the power of Pages when used together with an API-backed database on <a
                        href="http://cloud.gov">cloud.gov</a>. Pages' cloud infrastructure helps manage site traffic
                during spikes in visitors, making sure College Scorecard is always available.</p>

            <h2>AFWERX</h2>
            <p>In 2017, the Secretary of the Air Force established AFWERX — a technology accelerator that brings the
                best from academia and industry together to solve problems and enhance the Air Force's
                effectiveness.<br/>A military website needs military compliance, and Pages made it easy for AFWERX to
                get there. Because it's fully customizable, AFWERX could design a brand that would attract the
                cutting-edge contributors they were looking for. And because it's FedRAMP-authorized, they could launch
                their site knowing their security met the standards the Department of Defense demands.</p>

            <h2>Centers of Excellence</h2>
            <p>GSA's Centers of Excellence (CoE) program accelerates the modernization of IT infrastructure across
                government. But in early 2018, the CoE team was in need of their own modernization: their website was
                cumbersome, required vendors for updates, and took 30-45 minutes to make a single change.<br/>With
                Pages, CoEs can make their own changes — no outside help needed — in five minutes or less. Because
                everything's organized in one place, maintaining their website is simple, efficient, and easily managed
                by in-house staff. And thanks to Pages' modern, accessible templates, this signature White House
                initiative is now fully compliant with the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA).</p>

            <p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government-wide program that
                provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for
                cloud products and services. FedRAMP's choice to use Pages for its main website speaks to the security
                and reliability of the Pages infrastructure.</p>
