We've worked to make publishing a government site on Pages as simple as possible. Please note that while the entire process usually takes a couple days, it may take up to a week, so plan accordingly.

- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Launch Process](#launch-process)
- [Launch Checklist](#launch-checklist)

## Requirements
- You must have an active, signed IAA with Pages. Sandbox accounts without IAAs will be unable to configure custom domains and preview urls are **not** suitable for production use.

- Your agency must accept the risk of launching a site on Pages. Be sure to follow your agency's procedures and guidelines for operating your site using Pages.

- You must understand [your responsibilities]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ '/pages/documentation/customer-responsibilities' | url }}).

- Ensure you know how, or who to contact to make changes to the DNS configuration for your domain.

- If necessary, obtain a custom domain.

## Launch Process
1. Notify Pages support of your intent to launch along with your repository name/url and production-ready git branch via:
- email: `pages-support@cloud.gov`
- Slack: `#cg-pages`

2. Complete any site security scanning requirements as required by your agency CISO. Read our [documentation about required security scanning]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/documentation/external-tools-and-resources/#scanning-tools) for more information

3. Complete the process of [adding your custom domain]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ '/pages/documentation/custom-domains' | url }}). If you are migrating an existing site to Pages, make sure to review [minimizing downtime]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ '/pages/documentation/custom-domains' | url }}#minimizing-downtime)

4. Your site will now be live!
