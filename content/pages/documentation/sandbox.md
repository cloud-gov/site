## Getting started

If you're interested in seeing how Pages works for yourself, [let us know]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/), and we can create a sandbox environment for your team.

It's important to try a tool before committing to using it, and with Pages, we give you the power to do just that before having to do any paperwork.

We understand that signing agreements in the federal government can be slow, but you can read how [AFWERX]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/documents/AFWERX-case-study.pdf) was able to build their entire website in their sandbox environment and when they signed the agreement, the site was ready to launch to production.

## Ready to launch

If the Pages sandbox environment proves useful, our team will work with you through the necessary the IAA process. In the meantime, you are more than welcome to continue using the sandbox environment in staging. 

Once an IAA is signed, this is your green light to launch your site to the public. Per compliance, we cannot allow websites to be published to a production state until the necessary documents are signed and ready to go. However, we do encourage you to create and build whatever youâ€™d like in the sandbox.
