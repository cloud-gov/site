It's easy to add search functionality to a site.

We recommend using [Search.gov][], a free site search and search analytics service for federal web sites. You will need to [register](https://search.usa.gov/signup) for Search.gov and follow their [instructions](https://search.gov/get-started/searchgov-for-cloudgov-pages.html) to integrate this service with your Pages site. For full details, visit [Search.gov][]. 

If you'd prefer another solution, you can configure a tool like [lunrjs](https://lunrjs.com/) that creates a search function run using the client browser. An example of this is at the [18F blog](https://18f.gsa.gov/blog/). This avoids any dependency on another service, but the search results are not as robust.
