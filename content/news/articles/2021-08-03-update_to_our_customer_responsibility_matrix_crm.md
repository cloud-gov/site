date: 2021-08-03
excerpt: Today's update to our Control Implementation Summary (CIS) + Customer
  Responsibility Matrix (CRM) clarifies some language and inhertiance status for
  controls.
---
The **[Control Implementation Summary (CIS) + Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) + Control-by-Control Inheritance (.xlsx)](https://cloud.gov/resources/cloud.gov-CIS-Worksheet.xlsx)** is a summary of each Low and Moderate security control and whether it is handled by cloud.gov, shared responsibility, or customer responsibility. It includes guidance on which controls a customer system can fully or partially inherit from cloud.gov.

 We've made some recent changes to this document that we wanted to summarize for platform users, and those interested in implementing a solution on the platform. 

### Recent changes to CRM

* Added another page listing Low-impact controls, which provides color-coded conditional formatting to the CRM
