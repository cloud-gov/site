This release focuses on dependency updates, primarily that fix the latest Apache Log4j2 vulnerability, CVE-2021-45046, in dependencies used by the Java buildpack.

* In particular, the following dependencies were known to be vulnerable to CVE-2021-45046 & have been patched in this release:
  * AppDynamics Java Agent
  * New Relic Java Agent
If you are using an online version of the Java buildpack you do not strictly need this update, as the online buildpack will always pick the latest version of dependencies.

* Update outdated fixtures
* Update default python version to 3.10.x
* Add setuptools 59.5.0, remove setuptools 58.2.0

Old caching mechanism was very hacky and seemed to be the cause of miniconda test failures
(specifically tests which pushed twice, as the app would fail to start on the second push).
New approach uses CF's cache and conda's ability to set a package cache via CONDA_PKGS_DIRS.
