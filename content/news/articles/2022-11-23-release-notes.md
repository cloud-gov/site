# Change Log

## Customer Facing

### Noteworthy Changes and features
#### AWS Elasticache Redis versions
The aws broker now supports newer and multiple redis versions. Default redis is now AWS Elasticache Redis 6.2. Older and other versions can be selected by following https://cloud.gov/docs/services/aws-elasticache/#setting-optional-parameters.

Versions supported:
* 5.0.6 - previous default
* 6.0
* 6.2 - default
* 7.0

#### Application Disk Quota
The maximum Disk Quota an application can use is now 7GB up from 6GB. Disk Quota is how much disk space an application instance will have access to. 

Note: Disk Quota is not same as your organization's memory quota. 

Find how to specify disk quota here: https://cloud.gov/docs/management/limits/#app

### Go Buildpack - v1.10.0 up from v1.9.50

* Add support for cflinuxfs4 stack
* Add go 1.19.2, remove go 1.19 for stack(s) cflinuxfs4, cflinuxfs3
* Update Go Buildpack dependencies to only keep 1 of each patch version (latest)

### Java Buildpack - v4.53 up from v4.52

I'm pleased to announce the release of the java-buildpack, version 4.53. It primarily includes new OpenJDK versions, which are based on the Oracle Java Quarterly Updates for Oct 2022.

This release also includes an enhancement to the Sealights framework, more field are supported for a User-Provided service (Thanks to @alonweiss-sl via #964)

ðŸš¨ Deprecation of Spring Cloud Connectors & Spring Auto Reconfiguration ðŸš¨

This release reverts the change made in v4.51 which disabled the Spring Auto Reconfiguration framework by default. From this release, it will be enabled by default as per all versions < 4.51. This is to provide users with more time to migrate to the recommended alternative library, java-cfenv. The default of disabled will now happen in a release after March 2023, and the library will be completely removed in a release after March 2024. As before, you may post feedback/comments to this issue.

* Gorouter's pre-start script now reserves ports used by other CF components when it increases the number of ephemeral ports available via /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_reserved_ports. This resolves issues when components fail to start up during deploys/monit restarts due to accidental port collisions with outbound traffic from the VM. Thanks @ameowlia !
* Routing-release no longer makes use of the deprecated uaa-go-client, and uses go-uaa instead
* The routing_utils/nats_client helper utility now supports saving + loading gorouter's routing tables! Thanks @domdom82 !
* Fixed a memory leak with gorouter that resulted in HTTP request objects being held open if a client canceled the connection before the App responded. Thanks @geofffranks !
