USN-5391-1 USN-5391-1: libsepol vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2021-36084: The CIL compiler in SELinux 3.2 has a use-after-free in __cil_verify_classperms (called from __cil_verify_classpermission and __cil_pre_verify_helper).
* CVE-2021-36085: The CIL compiler in SELinux 3.2 has a use-after-free in __cil_verify_classperms (called from __verify_map_perm_classperms and hashtab_map).
* CVE-2021-36086: The CIL compiler in SELinux 3.2 has a use-after-free in cil_reset_classpermission (called from cil_reset_classperms_set and cil_reset_classperms_list).
* CVE-2021-36087: The CIL compiler in SELinux 3.2 has a heap-based buffer over-read in ebitmap_match_any (called indirectly from cil_check_neverallow). This occurs because there is sometimes a lack of checks for invalid statements in an optional block.

* Addresses USN-5376-3 USN-5376-3: Git regression

USN-5380-1 USN-5380-1: Bash vulnerability:

* CVE-2019-18276: An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 patch 11. By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support "saved UID" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use "enable -f" for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.

USN-5379-1 USN-5379-1: klibc vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2021-31870: An issue was discovered in klibc before 2.0.9. Multiplication in the calloc() function may result in an integer overflow and a subsequent heap buffer overflow.
* CVE-2021-31871: An issue was discovered in klibc before 2.0.9. An integer overflow in the cpio command may result in a NULL pointer dereference on 64-bit systems.
* CVE-2021-31872: An issue was discovered in klibc before 2.0.9. Multiple possible integer overflows in the cpio command on 32-bit systems may result in a buffer overflow or other security impact.
* CVE-2021-31873: An issue was discovered in klibc before 2.0.9. Additions in the malloc() function may result in an integer overflow and a subsequent heap buffer overflow.
* CVE-2021-31870: An issue was discovered in klibc before 2.0.9. Multiplication in the calloc() function may result in an integer overflow and a subsequent heap buffer overflow.

USN-5378-2 USN-5378-2: XZ Utils vulnerability:

* CVE-2022-1271: arbitrary file overwrite with crafted file names

USN-5378-1 USN-5378-1: Gzip vulnerability:

* CVE-2022-1271: arbitrary file overwrite with crafted file names

USN-5376-1 USN-5376-1: Git vulnerability:

* CVE-2022-24765: On multi-user machines, Git users might find themselves unexpectedly in a Git worktree, e.g. when there is a scratch space (/scratch/) intended for all users and another user created a repository in /scratch/.git. Merely having a Git-aware prompt that runs git status (or git diff) and navigating to a directory which is supposedly not a Git worktree, or opening such a directory in an editor or IDE such as VS Code or Atom, will potentially run commands defined by that other user via /scratch/.git/config.

USN-5331-2 USN-5331-2: tcpdump vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2018-16301: The command-line argument parser in tcpdump before 4.99.0 has a buffer overflow in tcpdump.c:read_infile(). To trigger this vulnerability the attacker needs to create a 4GB file on the local filesystem and to specify the file name as the value of the -F command-line argument of tcpdump.
* CVE-2020-8037: The ppp decapsulator in tcpdump 4.9.3 can be convinced to allocate a large amount of memory.
* CVE-2018-16301: The command-line argument parser in tcpdump before 4.99.0 has a buffer overflow in tcpdump.c:read_infile(). To trigger this vulnerability the attacker needs to create a 4GB file on the local filesystem and to specify the file name as the value of the -F command-line argument of tcpdump.
* CVE-2020-8037: The ppp decapsulator in tcpdump 4.9.3 can be convinced to allocate a large amount of memory.

USN-5366-1 USN-5366-1: FriBidi vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2022-25309: fribidi: Heap-buffer-overflow in fribidi_cap_rtl_to_unicode

USN-5359-1 USN-5359-1: rsync vulnerability:

* CVE-2018-25032: zlib before 1.2.12 allows memory corruption when deflating (i.e., when compressing) if the input has many distant matches.

USN-5355-1 USN-5355-1: zlib vulnerability:

* CVE-2018-25032: zlib 1.2.11 allows memory corruption when deflating (i.e., when compressing) if the input has many distant matches.

USN-5342-1 USN-5342-1: Python vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2021-3426: There's a flaw in Python 3's pydoc. A local or adjacent attacker who discovers or is able to convince another local or adjacent user to start a pydoc server could access the server and use it to disclose sensitive information belonging to the other user that they would not normally be able to access. The highest risk of this flaw is to data confidentiality. This flaw affects Python versions before 3.8.9, Python versions before 3.9.3 and Python versions before 3.10.0a7.
* CVE-2021-4189: [ftplib should not use the host from the PASV response]
* CVE-2022-0391: A flaw was found in Python, specifically within the urllib.parse module. This module helps break Uniform Resource Locator (URL) strings into components. The issue involves how the urlparse method does not sanitize input and allows characters like '\r' and '\n' in the URL path. This flaw allows an attacker to input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks. This flaw affects Python versions prior to 3.10.0b1, 3.9.5, 3.8.11, 3.7.11 and 3.6.14.

USN-5329-1 USN-5329-1: tar vulnerability:

* CVE-2021-20193: A flaw was found in the src/list.c of tar 1.33 and earlier. This flaw allows an attacker who can submit a crafted input file to tar to cause uncontrolled consumption of memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

USN-5328-1 USN-5328-1: OpenSSL vulnerability:

* CVE-2022-0778: Infinite loop in BN_mod_sqrt() reachable when parsing certificates

USN-5324-1 USN-5324-1: libxml2 vulnerability:

* CVE-2022-23308: valid.c in libxml2 before 2.9.13 has a use-after-free of ID and IDREF attributes.
