### CF CLI  1.56.0 up from 1.53.0

This release contains the following versions of the CF CLI:


| Major Version | Prior Version | Current Version |
| --------------|---------------|-----------------|
| v8 | 8.7.6 | [8.7.6](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v8.7.6) |
| v7 | 7.7.6 | [7.7.6](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v7.7.6) |
| v6 | 6.53.0 | [6.53.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.53.0) |




### CFLinuxfs4 - 1.61.0 up from 1.54.0 

Notably, this release addresses:

* `USN-6535-1 USN-6535-1`: curl vulnerabilities:
    * `CVE-2023-46218`: cookie mixed case PSL bypass
    * `CVE-2023-46219`: HSTS long file name clears contents
    * `CVE-2023-46219`: HSTS long file name clears contents
    * `CVE-2023-46218`: cookie mixed case PSL bypass

* `USN-6541-1 USN-6541-1`: GNU C Library vulnerabilities:
    * `CVE-2023-4813`: A flaw was found in glibc. In an uncommon situation, the gaih_inet function may use memory that has been freed, resulting in an application crash. This issue is only exploitable when the getaddrinfo function is called and the hosts database in /etc/nsswitch.conf is configured with SUCCESS=continue or SUCCESS=merge.
    * `CVE-2023-4806`: A flaw was found in glibc. In an extremely rare situation, the getaddrinfo function may access memory that has been freed, resulting in an application crash. This issue is only exploitable when a NSS module implements only the nss_gethostbyname2_r and nss_getcanonname_r hooks without implementing the nss*_gethostbyname3_r hook. The resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the call to the getaddrinfo function should have the AF_INET6 address family with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL and AI_V4MAPPED as flags.
    * `CVE-2023-5156`: A flaw was found in the GNU C Library. A recent fix for CVE-2023-4806 introduced the potential for a memory leak, which may result in an application crash.

### Routing 0.284.0 to 0.285.0

* A new `localhost:8082` endpoint has been added for retrieving the routing table on gorouter. This is in preparation of removing non-TLS LB-health check endpoints from the public `:8080` listener for increased security. `/var/vcap/jobs/gorouter/bin/retrieve-local-routes` is updated and still the official way to retrieve the local routing table on a gorouter. The port this listens on can be configured via the `router.status.routes.port` property.
* A new TLS-enabled endpoint for LB health checks has been added on `:8443`. This can be configured via the `router.status.tls.port`, `router.status.tls.certificate` and `router.status.tls.key properties`.
* routing-api has been updated to work towards supporting a TLS-only CF deployment.
* gorouter's proxy package received some test enhancements for increased test stability.
* gorouter's `pool.Endpoint.Equals()` received a performance improvement
* Route-registrar will now fail if it configured to talk to NATS without using TLS. This can be toggled via the `nats.fail_if_using_nats_without_tls` property.

***A Note to Other CF Platform Operators***

If you have any custom releases bound to port 8443 on gorouters, this release will cause you issues with the health check.

* Fix pre-start.erb for Jammy FIPS stemcell
