* `USN-6565-1` USN-6565-1: OpenSSH vulnerabilities:

    * `CVE-2021-41617`: sshd in OpenSSH 6.2 through 8.x before 8.8, when certain non-default configurations are used, allows privilege escalation because supplemental groups are not initialized as expected. Helper programs for AuthorizedKeysCommand and AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand may run with privileges associated with group memberships of the sshd process, if the configuration specifies running the command as a different user.
    * `CVE-2023-51384`: In ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.6, certain destination constraints can be incompletely applied. When destination constraints are specified during addition of PKCS#11-hosted private keys, these constraints are only applied to the first key, even if a PKCS#11 token returns multiple keys.
    * `CVE-2023-51385`: In ssh in OpenSSH before 9.6, OS command injection might occur if a user name or host name has shell metacharacters, and this name is referenced by an expansion token in certain situations. For example, an untrusted Git repository can have a submodule with shell metacharacters in a user name or host name.

* `USN-6558-1` USN-6558-1: audiofile vulnerabilities:

    * `CVE-2018-13440`: The audiofile Audio File Library 0.3.6 has a NULL pointer dereference bug in ModuleState::setup in modules/ModuleState.cpp, which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted caf file, as demonstrated by sfconvert.
    * `CVE-2018-17095`: An issue has been discovered in mpruett Audio File Library (aka audiofile) 0.3.6, 0.3.5, 0.3.4, 0.3.3, 0.3.2, 0.3.1, 0.3.0. A heap-based buffer overflow in Expand3To4Module::run has occurred when running sfconvert.
    * `CVE-2019-13147`: In Audio File Library (aka audiofile) 0.3.6, there exists one NULL pointer dereference bug in ulaw2linear_buf in G711.cpp in libmodules.a that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.
    * `CVE-2022-24599`: In autofile Audio File Library 0.3.6, there exists one memory leak vulnerability in printfileinfo, in printinfo.c, which allows an attacker to leak sensitive information via a crafted file. The printfileinfo function calls the copyrightstring function to get data, however, it dosn't use zero bytes to truncate the data.
    * `CVE-2018-17095`: An issue has been discovered in mpruett Audio File Library (aka audiofile) 0.3.6, 0.3.5, 0.3.4, 0.3.3, 0.3.2, 0.3.1, 0.3.0. A heap-based buffer overflow in Expand3To4Module::run has occurred when running sfconvert.

* `USN-6557-1` USN-6557-1: Vim vulnerabilities:

    * `CVE-2022-1725`: NULL Pointer Dereference in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4959.
    * `CVE-2022-1771`: Uncontrolled Recursion in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4975.
    * `CVE-2022-1886`: Heap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.
    * `CVE-2022-1897`: Out-of-bounds Write in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.
    * `CVE-2022-2000`: Out-of-bounds Write in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.
    * `CVE-2022-2042`: Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.
    * `CVE-2023-48231`: Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue has been addressed in commit 25aabc2b which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
    * `CVE-2023-48232`: Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag. This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been addressed in commit cb0b99f0 which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
    * `CVE-2023-48236`: Vim is an open source command line text editor. When using the z= command, the user may overflow the count with values larger than MAX_INT. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit 73b2d379 which has been included in release version 9.0.2111. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
    * `CVE-2023-48237`: Vim is an open source command line text editor. In affected versions when shifting lines in operator pending mode and using a very large value, it may be possible to overflow the size of integer. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit 6bf131888 which has been included in version 9.0.2112. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
    * `CVE-2023-48706`: Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a heap-use-after-free vulnerability. When executing a :s command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the substitution part, it is possible that the recursive :s call causes free-ing of memory which may later then be accessed by the initial :s command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for the very first :s command. It may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue.

Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue.
    * `CVE-2023-48234`: Vim is an open source command line text editor. When getting the count for a normal mode z command, it may overflow for large counts given. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit 58f9befca1 which has been included in release version 9.0.2109. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
    * `CVE-2023-48231`: Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue has been addressed in commit 25aabc2b which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
    * `CVE-2023-46246`: Vim is an improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Heap-use-after-free in memory allocated in the function ga_grow_inner in in the file src/alloc.c at line 748, which is freed in the file src/ex_docmd.c in the function do_cmdline at line 1010 and then used again in src/cmdhist.c at line 759. When using the :history command, it's possible that the provided argument overflows the accepted value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been patched in version 9.0.2068.
    * `CVE-2023-48235`: Vim is an open source command line text editor. When parsing relative ex addresses one may unintentionally cause an overflow. Ironically this happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit 060623e which has been included in release version 9.0.2110. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
    * `CVE-2022-1725`: NULL Pointer Dereference in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4959.

Only users with non-default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been addressed in commit cb0b99f0 which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
    * `CVE-2022-2042`: Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.

    * `CVE-2022-1886`: Heap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.
    * `CVE-2023-48233`: Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s command is larger than what fits into a (signed) long variable, abort with e_value_too_large. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit ac6378773 which has been included in release version 9.0.2108. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
    * `CVE-2023-48236`: Vim is an open source command line text editor. When using the z= command, the user may overflow the count with values larger than MAX_INT. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit 73b2d379 which has been included in release version 9.0.2111. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
    * `CVE-2022-1771`: Uncontrolled Recursion in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4975.

    * `CVE-2022-4285`: An illegal memory access flaw was found in the binutils package. Parsing an ELF file containing corrupt symbol version information may result in a denial of service. This issue is the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-16599.

* `USN-6543-1` USN-6543-1: GNU Tar vulnerability:
    * `CVE-2023-39804`: [A stack overflow vulnerability exists in GNU Tar up to including v1.34. The bug exists in the function xattr_decoder() in xheader.c, where alloca() is used and it may overflow the stack if a sufficiently long xattr key is used. The vulnerability can be triggered when extracting a tar/pax archive that contains such a long xattr key.]
