### cflinuxfs3 - 0.274.0 up from 0.270.0

USN-5199-1 USN-5199-1: Python vulnerabilities:
* CVE-2021-3733: [Denial of service when identifying crafted invalid RFCs]
* CVE-2021-3737: [client can enter an infinite loop on a 100 Continue response from the server]
* CVE-2021-3737: [client can enter an infinite loop on a 100 Continue response from the server]
* CVE-2021-3733: [Denial of service when identifying crafted invalid RFCs]

USN-5235-1 USN-5235-1: Ruby vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2021-41816: [Buffer Overrun in CGI.escape_html]
* CVE-2021-41817: Date.parse in the date gem through 3.2.0 for Ruby allows ReDoS (regular * expression Denial of Service) via a long string. The fixed versions are 3.2.1, 3.1.2, 3.0.2, * and 2.0.1.
* CVE-2021-41819: CGI::Cookie.parse in Ruby through 2.6.8 mishandles security prefixes in * cookie names. This also affects the CGI gem through 0.3.0 for Ruby.

USN-5254-1 USN-5254-1: shadow vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2017-12424: In shadow before 4.5, the newusers tool could be made to manipulate internal data structures in ways unintended by the authors. Malformed input may lead to crashes (with a buffer overflow or other memory corruption) or other unspecified behaviors. This crosses a privilege boundary in, for example, certain web-hosting environments in which a Control Panel allows an unprivileged user account to create subaccounts.
* CVE-2018-7169: An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has used "group blacklisting" (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.

USN-5288-1 USN-5288-1: Expat vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2022-22823: build_model in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow.
* CVE-2021-45960: In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3, a left shift by 29 (or more) places in the storeAtts function in xmlparse.c can lead to realloc misbehavior (e.g., allocating too few bytes, or only freeing memory).
* CVE-2022-25235: xmltok_impl.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5 lacks certain validation of encoding, such as checks for whether a UTF-8 character is valid in a certain context.
* CVE-2022-25236: xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5 allows attackers to insert namespace-separator characters into namespace URIs.
* CVE-2022-22825: lookup in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow.
* CVE-2022-22827: storeAtts in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow.
* CVE-2022-22826: nextScaffoldPart in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow.
* CVE-2021-46143: In doProlog in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3, an integer overflow exists for m_groupSize.
* CVE-2022-23990: Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.4 has an integer overflow in the doProlog function.
* CVE-2022-22824: defineAttribute in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow.
* CVE-2022-23852: Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.4 has a signed integer overflow in XML_GetBuffer, for configurations with a nonzero XML_CONTEXT_BYTES.
* CVE-2022-22822: addBinding in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow.

### Nats Release - v43 up from v40

Release Highlight
* Optionally exclude password authentication for nats-tls. Thank you @domdom82 for submitting this PR!
* üêõ Bug-Fix: A new healthcheck for the nats-tls job alleviates the constant stream of log messages caused by incomplete TLS handshakes from health checks (fixes #32). Thank you @peterellisjones for the PR!
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è This requires two new properties to be provided to allow the health check to access nats via TLS, listed below.
* Improvement: Operators are now able to set nats.net and nats.cluster_host to adjust the listening address of the nats and nats-tls jobs for use in multi-homed environments. Thanks @psycofdj!
* Bug Fix: Operators can force-disable nats authentication via the nats.auth_required property, rather than removing credentials. This helps alleviate Authorization Violation errors seen in cases such as routing-release #259. Thanks @b1tamara and @Mrizwanshaik!

### Routing Release - 0.229.0 up from 0.228.0

* ‚ûï Improvement: Request URLs are now included in Gorouter's route-service-connection-failed log messages. Thanks for the improvement @plowin! üéâ
* ‚ûï Improvement: Gorouter's endpoint_dial_timeout is now configurable. It affects the time to establish a TCP connection with backends (http or websocket), but prior to any TLS negotiation.
* üêõ Bug Fix: A bug in Gorouter was resolved that caused incorrect counts when calculating backend-connection limits for app endpoints
* üêõ Bug Fix: Gorouter now honors the router.min_tls_version and router.max_tls_version properties when making requests to route-services
* üêõ Bug Fix: Resolves an issue introduced in routing-release v0.227.0 where the b3_spanid header was incorrectly being set to 16 bytes. It now is set to 8-bytes. Thanks @stijnvet for the fix! üéâ
