# Happy almost Turkey Day!

The cloud.gov team is working on providing change logs so everyone can see new features and updates. Some highlights include cf-deployment v17 and Concourse v7. Additionally, if you use the [PHP buildpack](https://cloud.gov/2021/11/15/dhs-bod-22-01/) and have not restaged your application since November 10th, 2021, please do that.

Now the optional rate_limiter will measure these requests in memory on the individual API VM.

X509 Subject Alt Name Requirements

The gorouter job will now fail to render its template on BOSH deploys if a tls_pem contains a cert_chain that does not have a SubjectAltName (SAN) extension on the certificate. This started being required in Golang 1.15, but we have been working around this using the golang.x509ignoreCN property. This property now defaults to false, so operators are made aware of any certs that need to be regenerated. When routing-release is built against golang 1.17, the golang.x509ignoreCN workaround will cease to function, and environments will need to have certs updated by then.

If encountered, the template rendering error will match: tls_pem[<cert index>].cert_chain must include a subjectAltName extension

For more information, see Golang 1.15's release notes

Bugfixes
* The gorouter template is now generated in a way that is compatible with BOSH Directors built with Ruby 3 (#225)
* Resolves an issue where a stale route for an app using route services with an out of date route-service URL could result in all requests going to the out-of-date route-service URL, and failing.
* Clarifies gorouter logs and routing tables to reflect http1 as the protocol when HTTP/2 is disabled, even if the route was registered indicating it supported HTTP/2.
