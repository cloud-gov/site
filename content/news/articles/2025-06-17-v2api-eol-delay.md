## Delaying end-of-life for CloudFoundry API v2

In January, 2025, Cloud.gov announced that [we were following the lead of the Cloud Foundry Foundation in discontinuing the v2 API]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/01/07/v2api-deprecation/).

However, updating all the remaining codebases within the Cloud Foundry ecosystem to use the v3 API has been taking the community longer than expected. This includes code that Cloud.gov is dependent upon. We are working with the community to resolve these dependencies, or to deploy v3 API alternatives.

We will announce a new 90-day deprecation timeline later in 2025, once all internal dependencies are resolved.
