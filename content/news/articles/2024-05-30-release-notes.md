This release contains support for Tomcat 10.1 in the form of a new version line, as well as some framework dependency bumps. It also contains the April Java patch releases for 8, 11, 17 & 21, as well as some framework dependency bumps.

The default version of Tomcat will remain at 9.x, but you can now specify 10.1.x to be used by the buildpack, in the same way as changing the JRE version.

```shell
cf set-env <tomcat-app> JBP_CONFIG_TOMCAT '{ tomcat: { version: 10.1.+ } }'
```
