### Now it’s easier than ever to get started with cloud.gov.
We’re delighted to announce that cloud.gov has received a FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB) Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) at the Moderate impact level. This means that cloud.gov successfully completed a comprehensive security and compliance assessment performed by a board of the CIOs and their teams from the General Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Homeland Security. cloud.gov is the [first completely open source service to receive FedRAMP authorization](https://www.gsa.gov/blog/2017/02/02/cloudgov-becomes-first-fully-open-source-fedramp-solution). Teams can now use cloud.gov with less upfront work, so they can use cloud.gov to deliver services even faster.

### Other new and improved features

#### Native multifactor authentication
For teams that cannot integrate their agency single sign-on authentication provider with cloud.gov, or for teammates who don’t have access to agency accounts (such as some contractors), cloud.gov now provides a [built-in authentication option]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/accounts#to-log-into-cloud-gov) with multifactor authentication. This is not yet included in the FedRAMP Authorization, but teams can use it if their agency approves.

#### Clearer pricing and product information
We’ve been making changes to the cloud.gov website in order to make our [pricing model]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/pricing/pricing-model) and our offerings clearer. We will continue to make improvements to the website and can only do so with feedback from our visitors. If you have anything to share with us, drop us a line at [inquiries@cloud.gov](mailto:inquiries@cloud.gov).

#### A more functional dashboard for using cloud.gov without using the command line
Our web-based [dashboard](https://dashboard.fr.cloud.gov/) gives people an easy web-based way to manage their applications. You can see an overview of your apps, spaces, and their current state. The dashboard now offers more visual clarity between activities. And now you can edit limits on your applications with a few clicks.
