### CFLinuxfs4 - 1.54.0 up from 1.51.0 

Notably, this bump addresses:

* `USN-6505-1` USN-6505-1: nghttp2 vulnerability: 
    * `CVE-2023-44487`: The HTTP/2 protocol allows a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation can reset many streams quickly, as exploited in the wild in August through October 2023.
* `USN-6499-1` USN-6499-1: GnuTLS vulnerability: 
    * `CVE-2023-5981`: [timing side-channel inside RSA-PSK key exchange]

 * `USN-6517-1` USN-6517-1: Perl vulnerabilities:

    * `CVE-2022-48522`: In Perl 5.34.0, function S_find_uninit_var in sv.c has a stack-based crash that can lead to remote code execution or local privilege escalation.
    * `CVE-2023-47038`: [A crafted regular expression when compiled by perl 5.30.0 through 5.38.0 can cause a one attacker controlled byte buffer overflow in a heap allocated buffer]
    * `CVE-2022-48522`: In Perl 5.34.0, function S_find_uninit_var in sv.c has a stack-based crash that can lead to remote code execution or local privilege escalation.
    * `CVE-2023-47038`: [A crafted regular expression when compiled by perl 5.30.0 through 5.38.0 can cause a one attacker controlled byte buffer overflow in a heap allocated buffer]

* USN-6512-1 USN-6512-1: LibTIFF vulnerabilities:
    * `CVE-2022-40090`: An issue was discovered in function TIFFReadDirectory libtiff before 4.4.0 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via crafted TIFF file.
    * `CVE-2023-3576`: A memory leak flaw was found in Libtiff's tiffcrop utility. This issue occurs when tiffcrop operates on a TIFF image file, allowing an attacker to pass a crafted TIFF image file to tiffcrop utility, which causes this memory leak issue, resulting an application crash, eventually leading to a denial of service.
    * `CVE-2023-3576`: A memory leak flaw was found in Libtiff's tiffcrop utility. This issue occurs when tiffcrop operates on a TIFF image file, allowing an attacker to pass a crafted TIFF image file to tiffcrop utility, which causes this memory leak issue, resulting an application crash, eventually leading to a denial of service.
