## Summary

Cloud.gov’s funding source (the Acquisition Services Fund) requires us to review our expenditures and adjust rates to cover the cost of running the service. Starting on October 1, 2019, new interagency agreements (including renewals) will use the following prices. Agreements already in place will not change, and any modification or amendment to an existing agreement in FY20 will retain the original rate until FY21.

## Access fees

Plan  | Previous monthly price | New monthly price  |
--------- | ----------- | -----
`Prototyping` | $1,250.00/month |  $1,550.00/month |
`FISMA Low` | $1,666.67/month |  $2,070.00/month | 
`FISMA Moderate` | $7,500.00/month |  $9,300.00/month |


## Memory quota cost

Resource  | Previous monthly price | New monthly price  |
--------- | ----------- | -----
`Memory` | Approximately $105 per gigabyte/month |  $130 per gigabyte/month |


## Additional details

- To simplify billing, we will calculate memory costs monthly instead of daily. We will prorate the billing for modifications in the middle of the month, such as memory quota changes or agreements that start in the middle of the month.

- RDS, S3, Elasticsearch, and Redis will now run on “high-availability” servers, providing you with additional stability and redundancy.

- Previously, cloud.gov provided RDS, S3, Elasticsearch, and Redis at no additional cost for a “limited time.” We will continue to provide these services at no additional cost as long as your memory quota remains below the following limits. 

| | Previous storage cap | New storage cap | Additional Storage |
| --------- |----------------------| ----- | ----- |
| `RDS` | unspecified          |  1 TB | $300 per terabyte/month |
| `S3` | unspecified          |  5 TB | $100 per terabyte/month |
| `Redis` | 10 GB                |  10 GB | $100 per gigabyte/month |
| `ElasticSearch` | 10 GB                | 10 GB |  $100 per gigabyte/month |
