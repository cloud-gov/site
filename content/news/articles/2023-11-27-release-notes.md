# Change Log - Enjoy the Turkey Day leftovers!

## Customer Facing Changes
---

The audience for this section is developers who maintain applications on cloud.gov and may need to respond to stack or buildpack changes.

### CF-Deployment - v33.4.0 to v33.10.0

* Changes below are broken down by component

### CFLinuxfs4 - 1.51.0 up from 1.49.0

Notably, this bump addresses:

* `USN-6467-2`: Kerberos vulnerability: CVE-2023-36054: lib/kadm5/kadm_rpc_xdr.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.20.2 and 1.21.x before 1.21.1 frees an uninitialized pointer. A remote authenticated user can trigger a kadmind crash. This occurs because _xdr_kadm5_principal_ent_rec does not validate the relationship between n_key_data and the key_data array count.
* `USN-6477-1`: procps-ng vulnerability: CVE-2023-4016: Under some circumstances, this weakness allows a user who has access to run the “ps” utility on a machine, the ability to write almost unlimited amounts of unfiltered data into the process heap.


### Java-Buildpack 4.63.1 up from 4.63.0
* This release includes some agent framework dependency bumps, including a bug fix in Java CFEnv when using DB2, see [this issue](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/java-cfenv/issues/231) for more information.
