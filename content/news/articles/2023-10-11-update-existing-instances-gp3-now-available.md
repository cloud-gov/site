### Updating existing instances to `gp3` storage volumes is now supported

In a previous post, [we announced that **new** RDS and Elasticsearch/Opensearch instances created on cloud.gov would default to `gp3` for their storage volumes]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts/2023-09-18-storage-volumes-gp3).

We are happy to announce that updating your **existing** RDS and Elasticsearch/Opensearch instances to use `gp3` storage volumes is also now supported on cloud.gov.

### How to update your existing instances

To update an existing RDS instance to use `gp3` storage volumes:

```shell
cf update-service SERVICE-NAME -c '{"storage_type": "gp3"}'
```

[There is no expected downtime when updating the storage volume type for an RDS instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html).

To update an existing Elasticsearch/Opensearch instance to use `gp3` storage volumes:

```shell
cf update-service SERVICE-NAME -c '{"volume_type": "gp3"}'
```

[Updating the volume type to `gp3` for your Elasticsearch/Opensearch instance **will trigger a blue/green deployment and some amount of downtime**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/managedomains-configuration-changes.html#bg) while the instance upgrades.
