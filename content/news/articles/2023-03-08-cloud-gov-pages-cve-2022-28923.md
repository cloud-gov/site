excerpt: After reports of an open redirection vulnerability on cloud.gov Pages sites, we updated our platform's proxy to handle possible vulnerable requests.

On Tuesday March 7th, 2023, we received reports that cloud.gov Pages sites were susceptible to an open redirection vulnerability which could allow a nefarious actor to redirect users to phishing websites via crafted URLs. You can read about the NIST [CVE-2022-28923](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-28923) for more information. After verifying the reports, we released an update to our proxy in the afternoon of Tuesday March 7th, 2023 to handle any nefarious URL's with a 404 response. We also invalidated the CDN caches on customer's production domains to remove any potentially cached redirects.
