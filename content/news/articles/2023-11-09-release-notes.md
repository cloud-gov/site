### Java-Buildpack 4.63.0 up from 4.62.0

This release includes the Java quarterly patch releases, as well as updates to the following frameworks/agents:

* AppDynamics
* Azure App Insights
* Datadog
* Elastic APM
* JRebel
* Java CfEnv

Working on adding Java 21 support by default, for the moment users can add 21 as a version line in the [config file](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/blob/main/config/open_jdk_jre.yml) - since the binaries are already available, bundling the buildpack will then include this version.

For a more detailed look at the changes in 4.63.0, please take a look at the [commit log](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/compare/v4.62.0...v4.63.0). The packaged version of the buildpack, suitable for use with create-buildpack and update-buildpack, can be found attached to this release.
