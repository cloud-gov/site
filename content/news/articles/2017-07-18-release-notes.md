Curious what’s new that you might find helpful as a cloud.gov user? Here are highlights from our platform updates over the past two weeks.
<!--more-->

### Added
* If you need to access multiple S3 buckets using the same credentials — for example to copy files between buckets — you can use the `additional_instances` option when binding. Read the docs to [learn more about how this works]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/services/s3.md#using-s3-from-your-application).
* cloud.gov supports Oracle SE1 for relational databases. This is by request only until AWS GovCloud eventually supports SE2. You can read more about [relational database plans and how to request access to the Oracle service plan]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/services/relational-database.md).
* We created [a page explaining prototyping packages]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/pricing/prototyping.md), how you might use them, and what they cost.

### Changed
* If you have .NET applications you’re interested in running on cloud.gov, the updated [.NET Core buildpack](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/dotnet-core/index.html) supports [.NET Core 2 Preview (currently in alpha)](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/06/28/announcing-net-core-2-0-preview-2/). It’s ready for you to prototype with your .NET applications.

### Platform releases
We upgraded the Cloud Foundry deployment to [v267](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v267).

You should [restage your application](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/restage.html) to [incorporate fixes in the base filesystem](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/stacks.html#cli-commands) and ensure you’re running the most recent language version supported by your [buildpack](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/).
