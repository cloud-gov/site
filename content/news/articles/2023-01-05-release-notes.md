### loggregator-release v107.0.0 from v106.7.5

Remove RecentLogsHandler from Traffic Controller. Traffic Controller has been providing recent logs as a fallback for environments/tools which had not moved to retrieving recent logs directly from Log Cache. With this change older versions of the cf CLI v6 will no longer be able to retrieve recent logs from Cloud Foundry.

We are making this change as Log Cache has been the correct way of retrieving these logs for many years and the legacy support was causing issues with the splitting out of Log Cache from Dopplers.

What's Changed

* Remove RecentLogsHandler by @rroberts2222 in #486
* Bump golang.org/x/net from 0.3.0 to 0.4.0 in /src by @dependabot in #487
* Delete unused manifests & scripts, clean up README by @rroberts2222 in #488
* fix go module path by @Benjamintf1 in #490

### loggregator-agent-release v6.5.6 from v6.5.5

* fix scraping with non-positive intervals to preserve non-scraping behavior by @Benjamintf1 in #174
* updated some dependencies.

### nats v54 from v53

* Golang bumped to 1.19.4
* Ruby for internal testing bumped to v3

### routing v0.252.0 from v0.251.0

* Improve random source for least connection pool to be thread safe. Thanks Daniel Lynch!
