* Resolved a bug with dynamic ASGs when iptables logging was enabled that resulted in rules being flushed from running containers

### CFLinuxfs3 - v0.308.0 up from v0.301.0

USN-5495-1 USN-5495-1: curl vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2022-32205: Set-Cookie denial of service
* CVE-2022-32206: HTTP compression denial of service
* CVE-2022-32207: Unpreserved file permissions
* CVE-2022-32208: FTP-KRB bad message verification
* CVE-2022-32207: Unpreserved file permissions
* CVE-2022-32206: HTTP compression denial of service
* CVE-2022-32205: Set-Cookie denial of service
* CVE-2022-32208: FTP-KRB bad message verification

USN-5488-1 USN-5488-1: OpenSSL vulnerability:

* CVE-2022-2068: In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zf (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2ze).
