Curious what’s new that you might find helpful as a cloud.gov user? Here are highlights from our recent changes.

## Announcements


*Update*: Due to changes in customer needs, private network rollout was halted.


### 2019 FedRAMP annual assessment completed, cloud.gov granted re-authorization

Every year, to maintain [our FedRAMP Authorization]({{ site.baseurl }}/overview/security/fedramp-tracker/), cloud.gov goes through a robust security compliance audit to ensure our security measures are up to date with current federal standards. This enables our customer systems to inherit a significant amount of compliance from the cloud.gov platform, supporting faster ATOs and less work for their teams.

Our team has successfully completed this year’s re-authorization. Current and prospective customers can view our audit materials in the FedRAMP document repository on MAX.gov by [requesting access from FedRAMP]({{ site.baseurl }}/overview/security/fedramp-tracker/#start-the-ato-process).

## New additions


### Try an experimental feature for no-downtime deployments

It’s often a challenge to build a process for deploying new versions of your applications with zero downtime, without needing to double your memory usage. The [latest version of the Cloud Foundry command-line interface (CLI)](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) includes new beta commands to push apps using [rolling deployment](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/rolling-deploy.html). This makes it much easier to implement [blue-green deployment patterns](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html) without doubling your memory quota. (For example, this can replace the unmaintained [autopilot plugin](https://github.com/contraband/autopilot).) Install [the CF CLI update](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases), try it out, and let us know if you have any questions!

### Functions support for MySQL databases

If you need to set up a MySQL schema that includes functions, procedures, and triggers, you can now create new databases that have that feature enabled. [To do this, see the “Options” documentation for RDS databases.]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/services/relational-database/#options) This allows you to build a wider range of applications on cloud.gov.

### Improved instructions for running Drupal 8 for managing content

A lot of government teams run Drupal for content management for their websites, including the [Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/8) version. With some modifications, Drupal runs well on cloud.gov. We’ve improved our [instructions and sample code](https://github.com/18F/cf-ex-drupal8) showing how to run Drupal in cloud.gov with best practices including configuration-as-code and continuous deployment principles. 

### Automatically label your applications with version control information

Do you want to track which version of your code is running in each of your deployed applications? You can now use the cloud.gov API to automatically label your applications and other resources with your choice of metadata, such as the relevant git commit hash (SHA). For instructions, see [this guide to resource labeling](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/labeling-cloud-foundry-api-resources-with-a-git-sha/).

## Updated

We encourage staying up to date with the latest Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface (CLI) versions. The latest version is v6.46.0. [You can download the CF CLI update here.](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases)

We routinely update the operating system underneath your applications to ensure your applications are using the latest patched versions. For example, there was a high-severity Ubuntu Linux security vulnerability nicknamed [SACKPanic](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SACKPanic) that was announced on June 18, and we mitigated it by the evening of June 19.

## Removed

### Removed: CNAME ALIAS method for verifying DNS ownership

When using the [CDN service]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/services/cdn-route/) to set up a custom domain name for an application, cloud.gov now only offers certificate provisioning via DNS challenges. We stopped supporting the CNAME ALIAS method. See the [updated steps for setting up DNS]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/services/cdn-route/#how-to-set-up-dns).

### Removed: Experimental NFS (Network File System) volume service

We are no longer offering our experimental Network File System (NFS) volume service. We are still intending to offer a persistent filesystem option in the future.

## New faces in the cloud.gov team

We are excited to announce new people joining cloud.gov. Please welcome our newest members of the cloud.gov team!

In 2012, he served as a Code for America Fellow and worked with the city of New Orleans to help residents track the progress of vacant and abandoned homes. He also worked with Cornell University and the Department of Transportation (DOT) to develop Regulation Room, a commenting platform used to increase public participation in the regulatory process.
