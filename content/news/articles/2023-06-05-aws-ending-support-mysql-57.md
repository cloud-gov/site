[AWS RDS is ending support for MySQL versions 5.7.x starting in January/February 2024](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt.html).

> **Please note:** AWS has updated the end of support for MySQL 5.7 databases to January/February 2024. A previous version of this post said that support for MySQL 5.7 was ending December 2023.

## What this means for you

As a cloud.gov customer, if you are running a MySQL 5.7 database, then you will need to upgrade that database to at least MySQL version 8.0 by January/February 2024. **Affected customers will receive direct outreach from the cloud.gov team.**

To upgrade your database from MySQL 5.7 to 8.0, see the [guidance below](#how-to-upgrade).

If you do not upgrade your database by January/February 2024, then AWS will automatically upgrade your database to the next supported major version (currently 8.0) during the next maintenance window for your database.

## Important dates

|When|What|
|-|-|
| **June 5, 2023** | MySQL 5.7 databases can no longer be created on cloud.gov |
| **June 5 2023 - January/February 2024** | Window for customers to self-upgrade their MySQL databases to 8.0 |
| **January/February 2024** | MySQL 5.7 databases are fully deprecated by AWS. Any remaining databases are auto-upgraded to the next supported major version. |

## Updates to brokered database plans

As of today, June 5, 2023, it is no longer possible to create an RDS database using MySQL version 5.7 for any of the `mysql` plans in the marketplace. By default, version "8.0" will be used for new MySQL databases.

You can find more information about creating/updating RDS databases on [our database services documentation](({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/services/relational-database)).

## How to upgrade

To upgrade your existing MySQL 5.7 database to MySQL 8.0:

1. Target your organization and space:

    ```shell
    cf target -o <ORG> -s <SPACE>
    ```

1. Create a new database service using the same database plan as your MySQL 5.7 database:

    ```shell
    cf create-service aws-rds <plan-name> <mysql-80-database-name>
    ```

1. Use the [`cg-manage-rds` plugin](https://github.com/cloud-gov/cg-manage-rds#usage) to export a backup of your MySQL 5.7 database:

    ```shell
    cg-manage-rds export -f backup.sql <mysql57-database-name>
    ```

1. Import the backup into your MySQL 8.0 database:

    ```shell
    cg-manage-rds import -f backup.sql <mysql80-database-name>
    ```

1. Optionally, use the [`cf-service-connect` plugin](https://github.com/cloud-gov/cf-service-connect) to connect to your MySQL 8.0 database and verify that it contains the expected data:

    ```shell
    cf connect-to-service <app-name> <mysql80-database-name>
    ```

1. Bind your MySQL 8.0 database to your application:

    ```shell
    cf bind-service <app-name> <mysql80-database-name>
    ```

1. Unbind your MySQL 5.7 database from your application:

    ```shell
    cf unbind-service <app-name> <mysql57-database-name>
    ```

1. Restage your application (the `--strategy rolling` flag is optional but ensures no downtime):

    ```shell
    cf restage <app-name> --strategy rolling
    ```

1. Verify that your application is still working and operating with the expected data.
