## cloud.gov Page’s Federalist ATO Extension for GSA and non-GSA customers

We are thrilled to announce that the current Federalist ATO has been extended until February 28th, 2024 for all current non-GSA cloud.gov Pages customers and GSA customers alike. While we are excited to share this extension news with you it is crucial to emphasize that the current Federalist ATO will not, under any circumstances, be extended beyond February 28th, 2024. For our non-GSA agencies we understand the importance of predictability and planning for agencies such as your own and we want to ensure that you have adequate time to continue working towards obtaining your own agency specific ATO. We are continuing to research different cloud.gov support options for customers who would like guidance or assistance in navigating the ATO process going forward and we will communicate those to customers soon.
