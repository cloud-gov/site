### Attention cloud.gov Pages Users:

As cloud.gov Pages transitions to the FedRAMP authorization, the current Federalist GSA ATO covering non-GSA sites will be expiring and will not be able to be renewed. Starting April 1st, 2023, all new sites and renewals for non-GSA sites will be inheriting our cloud.gov Pages FedRAMP authorization for a FISMA low or moderate system. All current non-GSA sites will continue to have their sites covered under the GSA ATO until the end of their agreement or the end of FY23 (September 30, 2023), whichever comes first. We have the [FISMA low Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM)]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/cloud.gov-Pages-CIS-Worksheet.xlsx) available for cloud.gov Pages and you can start looking through it now.

For non-GSA sites that are renewing shortly after the April 1st, 2023 transition date, please reach out to us at [pages-support@cloud.gov](mailto:pages-support@cloud.gov) so we can schedule time to work through the new FedRAMP authorization with you. Also, we welcome meeting with your agency’s IT or CIO office to help understand your ATO process. Our goal is to make the process as seamless as possible and give customers a faster turnaround for site launches.
