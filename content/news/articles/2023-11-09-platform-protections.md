title: "New platform protections against malicious activity"
---

In response to some [recent incidents that caused outages on the platform](https://cloudgov.statuspage.io/incidents/n212qfbrqg83), the cloud.gov team has added new [platform protections against malicious activity]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/technology/platform-protections). Notably, the team has added rate limiting by IP address to mitigate the effect of surges of malicious traffic on the platform.

Adding these protections furthers our goal to provide a secure and reliable platform for cloud.gov customers. By documenting these protections, we hope to increase transparency about how your applications are protected.

If you have any questions about these new protections or if you think that they may be inadvertently affecting your legitimate traffic on the platform, please contact us at [support@cloud.gov]({{ site.support_email }}). As always, thanks for being a cloud.gov customer!
