If your application uses relational databases for storage, you can use the AWS RDS service to create a database instance. The `redundant` label in an RDS plan name indicates it is a [Multi-AZ (Availability Zone)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/multi-az/) deployment.

_\*Note: The actual database engine version used is the latest minor/patch version offered by AWS RDS for this major version_

_Only the `micro-psql` and `small-mysql` plans are available in [sandbox spaces](/docs/pricing/free-limited-sandbox#sandbox-limitations)._

You can always view an up-to-date version of this list directly in your command line as well with the following command (using `cf` CLI version 6):

```shell
cf marketplace -s aws-rds
```

Or, the following command (using `cf` CLI version 7 or later):

```shell
cf marketplace -e aws-rds
```

The dedicated plans listed above (marked "AWS RDS Latest") deploy the default version as advertised by AWS. If you need to determine the exact version of the RDS service deployed, see [this knowledge base article](/knowledge-base/2021-05-20-getting-rds-version-information/).

_Additional Cost:_ All databases have a limit of 1TB in storage. After 1TB, each additional terabyte will cost $300 per month.

## Choosing a database plan

For PostgreSQL and MySQL, we offer a range of database plans in different sizes (e.g. `micro-psql`, `small-psql`, etc).

The primary differences between each database plan size are the available CPU cores and memory for databases created with that plan. These parameters may be important to consider when choosing a plan for an application that is heavily CPU-bound or memory-bound.

The maximum number of available database connections will also differ between each plan size, in proportion to the available memory of that plan. Unfortunately, specifying the exact maximum number of database connections for each plan size is difficult because [the maximum is calculated by AWS using a formula](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Limits.html#RDS_Limits.MaxConnections) and not all of the inputs to the formula are known in advance to customers.

In general, the following guidance can be offered for the database plan sizes:

- `micro-*` plans: Good for prototyping and development
- `small-*` plans: Good for low-traffic applications
- `medium-*` plans: Good general purpose plan for applications
- `large-*` plans: Good for high-traffic applications
- `xlarge-*` plans: Good for very high-traffic applications

Once you have chosen a plan size, you should consider whether you need to run your database in [multiple availability zones](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/), which increases the availability and durability of your database.

For databases used for development or staging environments, redundancy may not be as critical. **But for databases used in production applications, you should always use a `*-redundant` database plan.**

If you need or want [a read replica for your database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html), use one of the `*-replica` database plans. The `*-replica` database plans also include redundancy of your database in multiple availability zones.

## Create an instance

To create a service instance run the following command:

```shell
cf create-service aws-rds ${SERVICE_PLAN_NAME} ${SERVICE_NAME}
```

For example, if you wanted to create a new micro PostgreSQL instance called `my-service-db`, run the following command:

```shell
cf create-service aws-rds micro-psql my-service-db
```

### Setting optional parameters

There are several optional parameters that you can specify when creating a new instance:

| Name                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Default Value                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `storage`                 | Number of GB available to the database instance                                                                                                                                                                                          | 10                            |
| `enable_functions`        | Boolean to enable functions, procedures, and triggers on MySQL databases                                                                                                                                                                 | false                         |
| `version`                 | Specifies a supported major version in RDS (must be in quotes)                                                                                                                                                                           | PostgreSQL: `15`, MySQL `8.0` |
| `backup_retention_period` | Specifies a number of days to retain daily snapshots.                                                                                                                                                                                    | 14                            |
| `binary_log_format`       | Specifies the format for [MySQL binary logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.MySQL.BinaryFormat.html). **Only supported for MySQL database plans**. Valid options: `ROW`, `STATEMENT`, `MIXED`. | ---                           |
| `enable_pg_cron`          | Boolean to enable [`pg_cron` extension on PostgreSQL databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/PostgreSQL_pg_cron.html) (requires PostgreSQL 12.5 and above; see example below for details)                      | false                         |

A couple of notes regarding the optional `version` parameter:

- It is currently only supported for dedicated MySQL and PostgreSQL instances; if you specify it for any other type of instance it is ignored.
- It only supports major version numbers (e.g. "8.0"); if you specify a minor/patch level version (e.g., "12.16" for PostgreSQL or "8.0.32" for MySQL), the command will fail.
- The version number must be provided in double quotes (`"`); this is because the value is treated as a string to account for different engine types and version schemes.

These are the current supported major versions for PostgreSQL:

- 12
- 13
- 14
- 15

_\*Note: [**For PostgreSQL versions 15+ , using SSL is required when connecting to your database**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.SSL.html#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.SSL.Requiring). As such, you will need to configure your client library to use SSL when connecting to your database._

These are the current supported major versions for MySQL:

- 8.0

The `backup_retention_period` can be no less than 14 days but extended up to 35 days.

#### Examples of optional parameters

If you want to specify the storage available (in gigabytes) to the instance:

```shell
cf create-service aws-rds \
    ${SERVICE_PLAN_NAME} \
    ${SERVICE_NAME} \
    -c '{"storage": 50}'
```

To enable functions, triggers, and procedures in MySQL instances:

```shell
cf create-service aws-rds \
    ${MYSQL_SERVICE_PLAN_NAME} \
    ${SERVICE_NAME} \
    -c '{"enable_functions": true}'
```

To specify the binary log format for a MySQL instance:

```shell
cf create-service aws-rds \
    ${MYSQL_SERVICE_PLAN_NAME} \
    ${SERVICE_NAME} \
    -c '{"binary_log_format": "ROW"}'
```

To enable the `pg_cron` extension for a PostgreSQL instance:

```shell
cf create-service aws-rds \
    ${POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_PLAN_NAME} \
    ${SERVICE_NAME} \
    -c '{"enable_pg_cron": true}'
```

After running this command, you must [finish setting up pg_cron on your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/PostgreSQL_pg_cron.html#PostgreSQL_pg_cron.enable). You can use [cf-service-connect](https://github.com/cloud-gov/cf-service-connect) to connect to your instance, or connect via an application. Note that you must target the `postgres` database. To do this via `cf-service-connect`, run `\c postgres` in the psql shell.

To specify a major version of a new instance, e.g., PostgreSQL version 14 (please note the double quotes (`"`) around the version number; they are required):

```shell
cf create-service aws-rds \
    micro-psql \
    my-test-service \
    -c '{"version": "14"}'
```

To extend the backup retention period for a database to 30 days:

```shell
cf create-service aws-rds \
    micro-psql \
    my-test-service \
    -c '{"backup_retention_period": 30}'
```

You can combine multiple optional parameters as long as the JSON is well-formed:

```shell
cf create-service aws-rds \
    small-mysql \
    my-test-service \
    -c '{"version": "8.0", "storage": 35}'
```

### Instance creation time

Dedicated RDS instance provisioning can take anywhere between 5 minutes and 60 minutes. During instance provisioning, the results of `cf services` or `cf service SERVICE_NAME` will show status as `create in progress`, as in the following example:

```shell
> cf services
name                 service   plan                bound apps   last operation
test-oracle          aws-rds   medium-oracle-se2                create in progress
```

Once the instance is ready for use, it will show `create succeeded` as below:

```shell
> cf services
name                 service   plan                bound apps   last operation
test-oracle          aws-rds   medium-oracle-se2                create succeeded
```

By default, when new spaces are created in your organization, an application security group (ASG) is applied that doesn't allow any outgoing traffic. You will need to [update egress traffic](/docs/management/space-egress) rules to allow for your app to reach the database.

## Update an instance

To update an existing service instance to a different plan run the following command:

```shell
cf update-service ${SERVICE_NAME} -p ${NEW_SERVICE_PLAN_NAME}
```

`${NEW_SERVICE_PLAN_NAME}` can be any of the _dedicated_ service plans that are listed above.

There are a couple of caveats regarding this command with the `-p` flag:

- You can only update using plans with the same database engine as your existing service instance. This means that if your original service instance was using a PostgreSQL plan (e.g., `micro-psql`), you can only update to one of the other `psql`-based plans.
- You can **only** switch service plans with this command; you cannot do things like upgrade your database version.

You can update to larger or smaller plans depending on your specific needs, and you can switch between redundant and non-redundant plans. You can also switch from a plan without a read replica to one with a read replica.

**NOTE: All updates are applied immediately. Performing an update in place like this will result in a brief period of downtime (seconds to minutes) while the service instance restarts as a part of the update.**

### Setting optional parameters

There are several optional parameters that you can specify when updating an existing instance:

| Name                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Reboot required? |

| `binary_log_format`       | Specifies the format for [MySQL binary logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.MySQL.BinaryFormat.html). **Only supported for MySQL database plans**. Valid options: `ROW`, `STATEMENT`, `MIXED`. | Yes              |
| `enable_pg_cron`          | Boolean to enable [`pg_cron` extension on PostgreSQL databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/PostgreSQL_pg_cron.html) (requires PostgreSQL 12.5 and above)                                                     | Yes              |
| `enable_functions`        | Boolean to enable functions, procedures, and triggers on MySQL databases                                                                                                                                                                 | Yes              |
| `storage_type`            | [RDS storage type to use for the database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html). Valid options: `gp3`                                                                                               | No               |

cf update-service ${SERVICE_NAME} \
    -c '{"storage_type": "gp3"}'
```

**Please note that databases must be at least 20 GB in size to use `gp3` as the storage type.** If you get an error during the update about your database storage size, try specifying a minimum value of `20` for `storage` (you can also choose a larger value) in the `update-service` command:

```shell
cf update-service ${SERVICE_NAME} \
    -c '{"storage_type": "gp3", "storage": 20}'
```

For the parameters [identified as requiring a reboot](#setting-optional-parameters-1), you need to request an instance reboot after the update in order for the changes to be applied. You can request a reboot of your RDS instance by emailing [support@cloud.gov]({{ site.support_email }}).

#### A note about upgrading major versions

**You cannot update an existing instance to a new major version** with the `update-service` command. If you'd like to update your existing database instance to a new major version, please email [support@cloud.gov]({{ site.support_email }}) for assistance.

### Rotate your credentials

> **NOTE: Rotating your database credentials will likely incur some downtime for your application.** [While AWS documentation states that existing connections using your current password are not dropped](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/reset-master-user-password-rds), depending on how your application handles database connections you could see errors
> trying to establish new connections until the application is restaged with the new credentials.

To change the password of your database instance:

```shell
cf update-service ${SERVICE_NAME} \
    -c '{"rotate_credentials": true}'
```

Once that command has finished running, you need to unbind your database instance from your application and re-bind it so that the application receives the updated credentials. **Please note that you may want to wait about a minute between running `cf unbind-service` and `cf bind-service`** otherwise you may get an error indicating that the database is not ready.

```shell
cf unbind-service <application-name> ${SERVICE_NAME} # wait a minute or so after running this
cf bind-service <application-name> ${SERVICE_NAME}
```

You will also need to delete and recreate any service keys for your database instance to incorporate the new credentials into the keys:

```shell
cf delete-service-key ${SERVICE_NAME} <service-key-name>
cf create-service-key ${SERVICE_NAME} <service-key-name>
```

Lastly, you need to restage your application so that it uses the updated credentials (tip: you can use the `--strategy rolling` flag to ensure your application instances remain available to handle traffic):

```shell
cf restage <application-name> --strategy rolling
```

### Bind to an application

To use the service instance from your application, bind the service instance to the application. For an overview of this process and how to retrieve the credentials for the service instance from environment variables, see [Bind a Service Instance](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#bind) and the linked details at [Delivering Service Credentials to an Application](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/application-binding.html).

In short, `cf bind-service` will provide a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for your app, which is then picked up by the `restage`.

The contents of the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable contain the credentials to access your database. Treat the contents of this and all other environment variables as sensitive.

Please note: If you are binding a service instance to a new space, please review and adjust your space egress setting. By default, all newly made spaces have their space egress set to closed which means any requests to the open internet or our brokered services will be blocked. For an overview of space egress settings, see [Space Egress](https://cloud.gov/docs/management/space-egress/).

## Backups and Recovery

Cloud.gov has provisioned AWS RDS databases so customers can restore to any point-in-time within their backup retention period (14 days minimum, up to 35 days). The point-in-time recovery may result in up to 5 minutes of data loss.

RDS automatically retains daily backups for 14 days. These backups are AWS RDS storage volume snapshots, backing up the entire DB instance and not just individual databases. You can extend the length of retention up to 35 days by using the `backup_retention_period` option detailed above. In addition, transaction logs from the AWS RDS instance are written to S3 every 5 minutes to enable point-in-time recovery.

**If you need to have a database restored** using one of these backups, email [support@cloud.gov]({{ site.support_email }}) with:

the Cloud.gov organization name

- the space name
- the database to restore
- the name of the application(s) connected to the impacted database service
- the point-in-time to restore (e.g. 15:15 EST on 12/12/2022).
- phone numbers and contact information if it's an urgent situation
- for non-emergency situations, please provide at least 48 hours advance notice.

**Please _do not_ share any passwords or details of any exploit or compromise.** We'll call you if necessary, and we'll never ask you for a password over the phone.

The Cloud.gov support team will restore to the nearest point in time BEFORE the time you've specified.

We'll confirm your information and remind you that a restoration may result in a brief period of downtime with database connectivity. Once we receive confirmation from you to proceed, we'll perform the restore, which results in a new DB instance being created in AWS RDS. Cloud.gov support will take care of renaming the new instance and configuring it with the same VPC and security group as the old instance in AWS so that it can still be found by your bound application(s) once the restoration is complete.

When the restore process is completely finished, we'll notify you and ask you to confirm that your application(s) is still functioning properly and that the data is properly restored. We'll also coordinate with you to determine when it would be appropriate to remove the old instance, particularly if it is needed for something such as a security audit or forensic analysis.

When we remove the old database instance, we will not retain snapshots or backups of it unless we're explicitly asked to do so. We'll remind you of this when coordinating a specific date and time to remove the old instance.

If you deleted your database instance and want to recover it, the recovery must be done within 14 days of the instance being deleted. We can perform a restoration using the automated backups that are retained for that 14 day window after a database is removed.

You can also create manual backups using the [export process](#exporting-a-database-manually) described below. In general, you are responsible for making sure that your backup procedures are adequate for your needs; see CP-9 in the Cloud.gov SSP.

## Tunneling to your database

Databases on cloud.gov can only be connected to from other resources within our internal network. You cannot make a connection directly from your local machine to a database hosted on cloud.gov.

To connect to databases hosted on cloud.gov, you need to use an SSH tunnel. Two options for creating an SSH tunnel are outlined below.

### Using `cf connect-to-service` to open a tunnel

First, open a terminal and connect to an instance using the [cf-service-connect plugin](https://github.com/cloud-gov/cf-service-connect#usage) to create a SSH tunnel:

```shell
$ cf connect-to-service -no-client ${APP_NAME} ${SERVICE_NAME}
...
Host: localhost
Port: ...
Username: ...
Password: ...
Name: ...
```

If this fails to open a SSH tunnel, try deleting any existing `connect-to-service` service keys first:

```shell
cf delete-service-key ${SERVICE_NAME} SERVICE_CONNECT
```

Then try the previous step again.

Once the SSH tunnel is created, keep it running in that terminal window to use the tunnel to make database connections.

The `Port` specified in the terminal output is the port on your local machine where the tunnel to your database is open. You should use this port when making connections to the database on `localhost` for utilities like `pg_dump`, `mysqldump`, or `mysqlsh`.

### Using `cf ssh`

> Note: you can find all the information for accessing your database (username, password, host, database name) by running `cf env app_name` for your app and looking at the `credentials` for your RDS database

Open an SSH tunnel to your database:

```shell
cf ssh -N -L <tunnel-port>:<host>:<db-port> <application_name>
```

with these values:

- `<tunnel-port>` - port to open on your local machine for accessing your database. This value can be any port that is available for use on your local machine.
- `<db-port>` - port database is running on in RDS
- `<host>` - AWS host for accessing your database
- `<application_name>` - your application name

If the `cf ssh` command succeeded, you should see an empty shell prompt that looks something like, which indicates that the SSH tunnel is open:

```shell
vcap@abc123-de45-fg67-hi89-jk10:~$
```

Once the SSH tunnel is open, your database should be available for connections on `localhost:<port>`.

## Exporting your database

### Exporting using `cg-manage-rds`

To perform a basic export of a PostgreSQL instance using the compressed format using [`cg-manage-rds`][cg-manage-rds]:

```shell
cg-manage-rds export -o "-F c" -f ./backup.pg ${SERVICE_NAME}
```

This will create an export using `pg_dump` named `backup.pg`. Other options for the pg_dump command can be pased as a string with the `-o` option.

### Exporting a database manually

1. [Create an SSH tunnel to your database](#tunneling-to-your-database) and keep it running in that terminal window
1. Open a separate terminal session in another window/tab
1. View the credentials for accessing your database by running `cf env app_name` for the app connected to your database and looking at the `credentials` for your RDS database
1. In the separate terminal window/tab, create the backup file (be sure to tailor the backup/export command to your specific needs).

   For example, to create a dump of a PostgreSQL database:

   ```shell
   $ pg_dump -F c \
       --no-acl \
       --no-owner \
       -f backup.pg \
       postgresql://<username>:${PASSWORD}@localhost:<port>/<db_name>
   ```

   with the values:

   - `<username>` - username for accessing your database
   - `<port>` - port opened for SSH tunnel to your database
   - `<db_name>` - database name

   This command will create the `backup.pg` file on your local machine in the current working directory.

1. When you are finished, you can terminate the SSH tunnel.

## Restoring to a database

### Restoring to a database using `cg-manage-rds`

This is a simple example of importing a previous export to database service instance. By default [`cg-manage-rds`][cg-manage-rds] adds options to remove ownership and create new objects to make porting easy.

```shell
cg-manage-rds import -o "-F c" -f ./backup.pg ${SERVICE_NAME}
```

### Restoring to a database manually

Once you have a database backup file, you can import the dump into another database.

1. If you want to restore to a cloud.gov hosted database, [you will need to first open a tunnel to that database which will expose a port on your local machine for connecting to the database](#tunneling-to-your-database).
   - If you are restoring to a local database, opening a tunnel is not necessary.
1. View the credentials necessary for accessing your database by running `cf env <app_name>` on the app connected to your database.
1. Use the commands for PostgreSQL/MySQL below to restore your database.

   - For importing to a cloud.gov database, the `<port>` value should be the port opened by the SSH tunnel on your local machine.
   - For importing to a local database, the `<port>` value should be whatever is configured for that database service

#### PostgreSQL

This pg_restore invocation does not drop all of the objects in the database when loading the dump, so if objects exist in a local copy of the database already, you might run into inconsistencies when doing a `pg_restore`:

```shell
pg_restore --clean --no-owner --no-acl \
    -h localhost \
    -p <port> \
    -U <username>
    --dbname=<database-name> backup.pg
```

If you want to drop and recreate the database before doing a restore, thus avoiding any data collisions, use the `--create` flag:

```shell
pg_restore --create --clean --no-owner --no-acl \
    -h localhost \
    -p <port> \
    -U <username>
    --dbname=<database-name> backup.pg
```

#### MySQL

Run this command to import a database backup into a MySQL database using the [`mysqlsh` tool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/):

```shell
mysqlsh -u username -p -h host -P port -D db_name -f path-to-file.sql
```

with these values:

- `username` - username for accessing your database
- `host` - AWS host for accessing your database
- `port` - port for accessing your database
- `db_name` - database name for accessing your database
- `path-to-file.sql` - Full path to the database backup file on your machine

## Database import errors

### MySQL

If you get an error like `ERROR: 1227` when trying to import to your database:

1. Make sure that `enable_functions` is enabled for your database:

   ```shell
   # on Linux / Mac
   cf update-service ${SERVICE_NAME} \
       -c '{"enable_functions": true}'

   # on Windows
   cf update-service ${SERVICE_NAME} \
       -c "{\"enable_functions\": true}"
   ```

   After making these changes, make sure to request a database reboot by contacting [cloud.gov support]({{ site.support_email }}).

1. Make sure that your database dump was generated with the `--set-gtid-purged=OFF` option. For example:

   ```shell
   mysqldump -h <host> \
       -u <username> \
       -p \
       --set-gtid-purged=OFF \
       <database_name> > backup.sql
   ```

If those steps do not help, additional remediation steps can be found in the [AWS knowledge center article on how to resolve this error](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/definer-error-mysqldump).

## Cloning a service instance using `cg-manage-rds`

This is a simple example of replicating database service instance to another instance using [`cg-manage-rds`][cg-manage-rds]. The destination database must be created beforehand. The export is downloaded locally as in the `export` command.

```shell
cg-manage-rds clone ${SERVICE_NAME_SOURCE} ${SERVICE_NAME_DEST}
```

## Opening a shell to your cloud.gov database

### Using `cf connect-to-service` to start a database shell

Run this command:

```shell
cf connect-to-service <APP_NAME> <SERVICE_NAME>
```

with the values:

- `<APP_NAME>` - the name of the app connected to your database
- `<SERVICE_NAME>` - the name of your database services

By default, `cf connect-to-service` should open a database shell for the relevant database type if you have the utility installed on your machine (e.g. `psql` for PostgreSQL databases).

### Using `cf ssh` to start a database shell

1. [Create a tunnel to your database](#tunneling-to-your-database)
2. In another terminal window, connect to the database:

   ```shell
   myapp_guid=$(cf app --guid <app_name>)

   creds=$(cf curl /v2/apps/$myapp_guid/env \
       | jq -r '[.system_env_json.VCAP_SERVICES."aws-rds"[0].credentials \
       | .username, .password] \
       | join(":")')

   dbname=$(cf curl /v2/apps/$myapp_guid/env \
       | jq -r '.system_env_json.VCAP_SERVICES."aws-rds"[0].credentials \
       | .name')

   psql postgres://$creds@localhost:5432/$dbname
   ```

   with values:

   - `<app_name>` - The name of the app connected to your database

## Encryption

Every RDS instance configured through cloud.gov is [encrypted at rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html). We use the industry standard AES-256 encryption algorithm to encrypt your data on the server that hosts your RDS instance. The RDS then handles authenticating access and decrypting your data, with minimal performance impact and without requiring you to modify your applications.

## Working with OracleDB

Since Oracle is not open-source there are fewer resources available online to get started working with OracleDB and Cloud Foundry. We provide a few tips here. This example worked with `ojdbc8.jar`, and will likely needs some tweaks for `ojdbc10.jar`.

### Demo with Spring Music and Oracle

To demonstrate the core Cloud Foundry / OracleDB functionality, we'll start by deploying the
[Spring Music app](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-music).

First, though, one needs the proprietary Oracle database drivers.
Visit the Oracle drivers' site at <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/application-development/jdbc/downloads/index.html> and download the `ojdbc8.jar` from the latest available release. You will need to have a valid Oracle profile account for the download.

Then, clone the repository and make a `libs/` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-music
cd spring-music
mkdir libs/
```

Copy the downloaded `ojdbc8.jar` to the `libs/` directory of `spring-music`.

Edit `build.gradle`, look for the following near line 60:

```java
    // Oracle - uncomment one of the following after placing driver in ./libs
    // compile files('libs/ojdbc8.jar')
    // compile files('libs/ojdbc7.jar')
```

and remove the `//` comment from the line for `libs/ojdbc8.jar`. Save the `build.gradle` file.

After installing the 'cf' [command-line interface for Cloud Foundry](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/), and logging in to cloud.gov, `cf login --sso -a https://api.fr.cloud.gov`, the application can be built and pushed using these commands:

```bash
cf create-service aws-rds medium-oracle-se2 spring-oracle
# Wait 20 minutes: get coffee, make a sandwich, ...
./gradlew clean assemble
cf push --no-start
cf bind-service spring-music spring-oracle
cf restart spring-music
```

When the restart completes, you can visit the app and view in the upper-right-hand `i` button that it's now using an OracleDB, or view the `/appinfo` path, as in: `curl https://spring-music-ADJECTIVE-ANIMAL.app.cloud.gov/appinfo`

### Connecting to Oracle

Install Oracle's `instantclient-basiclite` and `instantclient-sqlplus` for your operating system.

To get the database connection information, we'll use [Cloud Foundry service keys](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/service-keys.html) as follows, for the case of an Oracle database called `spring-oracle`:

```shell
$ cf create-service-key spring-oracle-key
Creating service key spring-oracle-key for service instance spring-oracle ...
OK

$ cf service-key spring-oracle spring-oracle-key
Getting key spring-oracle-key for service instance spring-oracle ...

{
  "name": "ORCL",
  "host": "cg-aws-broker-prod.RANDOMSTRING.us-gov-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
  "password": "secretpassword",
  "port": "1521",
  "uri": "oracle://random-username:secretpassword@cg-aws-broker-prodRANDOMSTRING.us-gov-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com:1521/ORCL",
  "username": "random-username"
}
```

Make an SSH tunnel from your workstation to Cloud Foundry to the OracleDB using the `host:` value, e.g. using port `15210` on the localhost:

```shell
cf ssh -N -L 15210:cg-aws-broker-prod.RANDOMSTRING.us-gov-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com:1521 spring-music
```

Now connect using `sqlplus random-username/secretpassword@host:port/ORCL`, where host is `localhost` and `port` is the first part of the `-L` connection string above. e.g.:

```shell
./sqlplus random-username/secretpassword@localhost:15210/ORCL
```

Then you can use SQLPLUS commands like `SELECT table_name FROM user_tables;`

## Version information

The software versions listed in the table above are for new instances of those plans.

New instances of dedicated RDS plans use the latest default database version available from AWS RDS GovCloud (US) at the time.

The PostgreSQL and MySQL plans are configured to automatically upgrade currently-running dedicated instances to the most recent compatible [minor version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.html) available via AWS RDS GovCloud (US).

For Oracle plans, minor upgrades are not automatic. To upgrade an existing Oracle database instance, please contact [support@cloud.gov]({{ site.support_email }}) and schedule a maintenance window for the upgrade to take place.

## The broker in GitHub

You can find the broker here: [https://github.com/cloud-gov/aws-broker](https://github.com/cloud-gov/aws-broker).
