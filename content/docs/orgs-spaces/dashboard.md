The online dashboard gives users web-based access to common tasks, such as managing organization users and permissions, instead of performing actions via the command-line interface (CLI).

## Log into the dashboard (web interface)

The cloud.gov dashboard is available at: [https://dashboard.fr.cloud.gov/](https://dashboard.fr.cloud.gov/)

Please note that adding users to organizations may return an error - if so, please use the new dashboard or CLI to perform this action.

### Managing users via the new dashboard

To manage users and their permissions, visit the "Cloud Foundry" link on the left menu of the dashboard. From there, you can add and edit org and space users and their permissions.
