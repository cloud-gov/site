Cloud Foundry (the underlying open source project behind cloud.gov) uses [buildpacks]({{site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/concepts/#buildpacks) to allow your applications to be deployed. cloud.gov [officially supports]({{ site.baseurl }}/pricing/) a set of buildpacks, and it also allows you to provide your own.

Once you push your code using a custom buildpack, cloud.gov cannot update it for you. You are responsible for keeping it up to date. Please see [this description of responsibilities]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/technology/responsibilities/).

## Example custom buildpacks

### apt-buildpack

cloud.gov does not allow the use of `sudo` inside of buildpacks. If your app depends on a library that is `apt-get` installable, you can use the CF flavor of [`apt-buildpack`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/apt-buildpack), which is a custom buildpack.

## Multi-buildpack support

If your application involves multiple languages, and it's not practical to split it into smaller applications (or the other options [under "Multiple languages" here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/concepts/#buildpacks), Cloud Foundry offers support for [using multiple buildpacks](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/use-multiple-buildpacks.html) for an application.
