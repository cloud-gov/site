  intro: |
    Most federal dev teams spend more time pushing paperwork around than pushing to production.

    Because we operate a FedRAMP-authorized cloud services platform inside the General Services Administration (GSA), our customers don’t need to navigate vendor contracts, new security reviews, or external approvals. Our infrastructure, pricing, and onboarding are designed specifically for government—**so you can focus on delivery, not procurement**.
