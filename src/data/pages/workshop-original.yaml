  intro: |
    It’s the perfect storm of complexity and amorphousness – where to even start? 
  content: |
    You endure endless cycles of compliance whack-a-mole, and craft the perfect SSP, only to go through yet another round of revisions with your 3PAO. Meanwhile, the pile of critical vulnerabilities just keeps growing. You’d love to update your toolchain and consolidate workflows, but there’s no way you’re fitting an RFP process into your timeline.
  outro: If only there was a better way, designed by people who know how the story goes…

  heading: There's a better way
  intro: |
    Turn your repos, roadmaps, and wireframes into real digital services with a sprinkling of Cloud.gov Workshop’s FedRAMP Moderate SaaS compliance dust.
  content: |
    Federal software engineers are most productive when they can be focused on building solutions that solve the public’s problems – not navigating an obstacle course with each new project. 
    
    Cloud.gov Workshop clears the tediousness of fragmented tooling and compliance friction, and provides a modern, efficient alternative for getting things shipped, and it’s built expressly for federal software teams on top of GitLab Dedicated for Government.

powerhouseTools:
  heading: Powerhouse tools at an optimal value 
  intro: |
    Assembling a similar toolset can be cost-prohibitive and complicated. But since Workshop is part of the Cloud.gov suite of products, purchasing and billing is straightforward and transparent. 
  items:
    - heading: Good structure
      text: Free namespaces allow agency partners to use less complicated permission structures, follow the principle of least privilege, and lay out their Cloud.gov Workshop spaces to meet program operational and security needs. This supports separation of duties, simplified permissions, and blast radius control. It also sidesteps the weaker structural choices that are sometimes necessitated when PaaS “organizations” (logical namespaces) are charged by structure. 

      icon:
    - heading: Leveraging automation
      text: CI/CD automation is a must for all teams, and including a small pool for free with each namespace supports the needs of most small teams/programs with no additional purchase. For larger teams or more complicated systems requiring many parallel CI/CD tasks, the additional charge for optional kinds of Cloud.gov Workshop Runner offerings can be justified in time savings.
      icon:
    - heading: Thoughtful storage
      text: Storage use tends to scale with the size of a team, so each Cloud.gov Workshop User includes an allocation of storage that’s added to the overall agency customer pool. Running out of space can wreak havoc on teams, stopping work or even causing outages, so hard quotas are not used. Metering and reporting will let customers to know if they’re nearing the limit of their storage pool size, offering a chance for clean up or to purchase additional space.
