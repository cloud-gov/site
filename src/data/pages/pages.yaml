  intro: |
    Publishing an agency update may seem simple, but federal websites are held to the highest standards for security, accessibility, and trust. That means wearing a lot of hats.
  content: |
    Teams tasked with public communication and service delivery are also expected to be **infrastructure, cybersecurity, and web design experts** — usually with limited access to training, budget, and staff.

    Today’s federal website managers must meet a growing list of responsibilities, including:
  items:
    - heading: "Audit your site for outdated or inaccurate content"
    - heading: "Check accessibility on every page (Section 508 compliance)"
    - heading: "Prove you're hosted on a FedRAMP-authorized platform"
    - heading: "Scan for vulnerabilities and address findings"
    - heading: "Renew HTTPS certs before they expire"
    - heading: "Complete and update your ATO documentation"
    - heading: "Review DAP analytics and identify areas to improve"
    - heading: "Confirm all content is searchable (e.g. integrated with Search.gov)"
    - heading: "Ensure you're using USWDS components and tokens correctly"
    - heading: "Publish federally required notices (privacy, FOIA, accessibility)"
    - heading: "Release datasets in machine-readable formats"
    - heading: "Archive past versions to meet records retention requirements"
  checks: true
  outro: |
    Managing all parts of a public-facing site is often buried under ‘other duties as assigned,’ but it’s one of the most visible responsibilities an agency has. It shouldn’t require **enterprise-scale effort from a two-person team**.
