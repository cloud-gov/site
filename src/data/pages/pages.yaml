  intro: |
    Publishing an agency update may seem simple, but federal websites are held to the highest standards for security, accessibility, and trust. That means wearing a lot of hats.
  content: |
    Teams tasked with public communication and service delivery are also expected to be **infrastructure, cybersecurity, and web design experts** — usually with limited access to training, budget, and staff.

    Today’s federal website managers must meet a growing list of responsibilities, including:
  items:
    - heading: "**Audit your site for outdated or inaccurate content**"
      text:    "(OMB M-23-22; OMB Circular A-130; 21st Century IDEA)"
    - heading: "**Check accessibility on every page**"
      text:    "(Section 508, 29 U.S.C. § 794d; 36 CFR Part 1194; 21st Century IDEA; OMB M-23-22)"
    - heading: "**Host your site on a FedRAMP-authorized platform**"

    - heading: "**Complete and update your ATO documentation**"
      text:    "(FISMA; OMB Circular A-130; NIST RMF-SP 800-37; NIST SP 800-53)"
    - heading: "**Review website analytics and identify areas to improve**"
      text:    "(OMB M-23-22; Digital Analytics Program (DAP) requirements)"
    - heading: "**Confirm all content is searchable**"
      text:    "(OMB M-23-22; 21st Century IDEA; Search.gov)"
    - heading: "**Use USWDS and adhere to the Federal Website Standards**"
      text:    "(21st Century IDEA website standards; OMB M-23-22; USWDS guidance)"
    - heading: "**Publish federally required notices**"
      text:    "(FOIA 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2); Privacy Act; OMB privacy guidance; OMB M-23-22)"

    Managing all parts of a public-facing site is often buried under ‘other duties as assigned’, but it’s one of the most visible responsibilities an agency has. It shouldn’t require **enterprise-scale effort from a two-person team**.
