    Federal digital teams deserve pricing that's as agile as their missions. Cloud.gov offers a straightforward, predictable approach that lets you deploy applications and scale infrastructure without budget surprises — scaling up or down without contract negotiations or hidden costs.

    Whether you’re managing a single website or an entire digital ecosystem, our pricing model adapts to your agency's evolving needs. **You'll always know exactly what you're paying for**, with no hidden costs or unnecessary bundled services.

      Optimize your team's costs with our flexible credit system, which lets you dedicate your infrastructure spend towards the specific services you need, when you need them.
      
      Credits empower you to tune your cloud resources  throughout the year. Think of them like rollover minutes. As your needs change, you can scale up or down as needed—**without modifying your agreement** or paying a premium all year for short-term peaks. 

      Your credits unlock a wide range of cloud services, from pre-configured database and caching instances to dynamically metered resources like storage, memory, and SES, giving you granular control over your infrastructure and cost.

  intro: |
    Forget months-long vendor negotiations and complex Request for Proposal (RFP) processes. We've redesigned procurement to work the way government actually works.

    We simplify government technology, we don't monetize its difficulty. Our Interagency Agreement (IAA) model is purpose-built for federal agencies like yours, eliminating the friction and cost of traditional IT procurement by offering:
  content: |
    - **Direct agency partnership:** Work directly with fellow government employees, not sales teams
    - **Rapid onboarding:** Most agencies complete our IAA process in weeks, not months
    - **Proven track record:** We’ve executed hundreds of previous IAAs across federal agencies
    - **Zero vendor overhead:** 100% of your investment goes directly to platform development
  outro: "Most cloud providers see federal tech as a lucrative problem to exploit. We know it’s a mission to support."
