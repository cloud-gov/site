      Optimize your team's costs with our flexible credit system, which lets you dedicate your infrastructure spend towards the specific services you need, when you need them.
      
      Credits empower you to tune your cloud resources  throughout the year. Think of them like rollover minutes. As your needs change, you can scale up or down as needed—**without modifying your agreement** or paying a premium all year for short-term peaks. 

      Your credits unlock a wide range of cloud services, from pre-configured database and caching instances to dynamically metered resources like storage, memory, and SES, giving you granular control over your infrastructure and cost.

      Use your Cloud.gov service credits to create the plan that works for you. Start with enough seats for your first team and namespace, which comes with a small 10-job runner and 10GiB of storage per seat towards your total allocation. 
      
      Have more than one team, or a more complex organization? Add as many namespaces as you want, structure them to your needs, and scale them individually. When one of your namespaces needs capacity for more than 10 parallel jobs, you can increase that namespace's Runner Pool up to 80 jobs. 
      
      Additional storage is also available. **We don't charge per repository or namespace*, because your contract structure shouldn't dictate how you organize your code.

  intro: |
    Forget months-long vendor negotiations and complex Request for Proposal (RFP) processes. We've redesigned procurement to work the way government actually works.

  content: |
    We simplify government technology, we don't monetize its difficulty. Our Interagency Agreement (IAA) model is purpose-built for federal agencies like yours, eliminating the friction and cost of traditional IT procurement by offering:

    - **Direct agency partnership:** Work directly with fellow government employees, not sales teams
    - **Rapid onboarding:** Most agencies complete our IAA process in weeks, not months
    - **Proven track record:** We’ve executed hundreds of previous IAAs across federal agencies
    - **Zero vendor overhead:** 100% of your investment goes directly to platform development

    Many technology providers simply repurpose private sector tools, leaving you to navigate critical compliance and integration challenges on your own. At Cloud.​gov, we proactively address these challenges, building in compliance and integration from the start, so you can focus on your mission.
