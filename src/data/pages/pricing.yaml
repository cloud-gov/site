      You purchase access to **Cloud.gov Apps** by buying a tier with enough credits to support your needs. Credits can be spent on application memory or managed cloud services like databases.

      Credits can be used flexibly throughout the year. That means if your usage varies, you can scale up or down as needed—**without changing your agreement** or paying all year for short-term peaks.

  intro: |
    Forget months-long vendor negotiations and complex Request for Proposal (RFP) processes. As a federal team within GSA, we've redesigned procurement to work the way government actually works.

    We simplify government technology, we don't monetize its difficulty. Our Interagency Agreement (IAA) model is purpose-built for federal agencies like yours, eliminating the friction and cost of traditional IT procurement by offering:
  content: |
    - **Direct agency partnership:** Work directly with fellow government employees, not sales teams
    - **Rapid onboarding:** Most agencies complete our IAA process in weeks, not months
    - **Proven track record:** We’ve executed hundreds of previous IAAs across federal agencies
    - **Zero vendor overhead:** 100% of your investment goes directly to platform development
  outro: "Most cloud providers see federal tech as a lucrative problem to exploit. We know it’s a mission to support."
