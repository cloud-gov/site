Curious what’s new that you might find helpful as a cloud.gov application developer? Here are highlights from our platform updates over the past two weeks.
<!--more-->

### Added
You can download the [cloud.gov Control Implementation Summary + Customer Responsibility Matrix]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/security/fedramp-tracker#how-you-can-use-this), a summary from the FedRAMP JAB P-ATO documentation. It lists whether each Low and Moderate security control is handled by cloud.gov, shared responsibility, or customer responsibility.

### Fixed
- In the dashboard, when you reach the end of your activity log, the log no longer displays a “Show more” button. Previously this button implied there might be more content when there was not.
- If you’re a member of many organizations, the dashboard can now display all of the spaces and apps for which you're a member. Previously, on the overview page, some organizations would appear empty or with some spaces and apps missing.

### Security

cloud.gov is now included in the [18F vulnerability disclosure policy](https://18f.gsa.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/), which gives guidelines for security researchers from the public.
