## Cloud.gov and the compliance community

Part of the mission of cloud.gov is to improve cloud adoption across the U.S. government, irrespective of vendor. In that vein, we support the FedRAMP®️ Compliance Practitioner Community of Practice, an email listserv supported by GSA's [Digital.gov](https://digital.gov/).

The goal of the community is to bring together people working on FedRAMP compliance to address common questions and concerns.  We strive to maintain an inclusive, professional community that engages in on-topic discussions. The community is not associated with the FedRAMP Program Management Office.

By voluntarily participating in this community, you are agreeing to abide by these guidelines and the [TTS code of conduct](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/about-us/code-of-conduct/). If you do not agree, email us at [community@cloud.gov](mailto:community@cloud.gov), and we will unsubscribe you from the LISTSERV mailing list.

When GSA becomes aware of alleged violations of the guidelines or code of conduct, we will review and evaluate the incident and determine an appropriate course of action. In accordance with GSA’s policies and legal guidance, the cloud.gov team implements this process.

Courses of action include:

* taking no action,
* sending a reminder for infractions, and
* issuing a first or second notice for violations.

Severe or repeated violations may result in temporary or permanent removal from the community.

Email us at [community@cloud.gov](mailto:community@cloud.gov) to report an alleged violation.

## Who can join?

The community is open to:

* compliance staff at CSPs listed in the [FedRAMP Marketplace](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov) as authorized or in-process
* compliance staff at CSPs pursuing authorization per their public statements (website, pdf)
* contracted staff dedicated to supporting FedRAMP authorization for client CSPs

The cloud.gov compliance team will approve memberships based on eligibility evidence.

## How to join?

Send an email to [community@cloud.gov](mailto:community@cloud.gov) providing:

* Your name and role
* CSP name and FedRAMP status
* Statement of interest (required if your CSP is not on the marketplace)

## Your communications are not private

As a federal agency, GSA is subject to records access requests such as the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). We must comply with requests for records made under FOIA. All communications made on the mailing lists are subject to release under FOIA, or potentially compromised by an adversary.  We are not in a position to background check participants beyond a cursory CSP domain validation.

## Follow the ground rules

We all have a responsibility to ensure the community is a safe space for everyone and free from harassment. It is appropriate to have and express differing opinions, as long as they are expressed in a respectful manner.

When dealing with sensitive topics or during disagreements, written statements can often sound more aggressive than when we speak them out loud. Review your message before pressing send. Think about how it may appear to its recipients. Remember, each message goes to thousands of people. When in doubt, don’t send it out.

Words matter. Choose words that create a safe, inclusive, respectful, and welcoming environment. Take a look at the following resources on inclusive language for additional information.

* [Inclusive language](https://content-guide.18f.gov/our-style/inclusive-language/) - 18F Content Guide
