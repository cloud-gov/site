The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) periodically issues “[Emergency Directives](https://cyber.dhs.gov/directives/),” which require action by cloud.gov, as a FedRAMP-authorized service.

In response to CISA Emergency Directives, cloud.gov will:
* provide required applicability information in our [FedRAMP secure repository: https://community.max.gov/x/mjypgg](https://community.max.gov/x/mjypgg)
* provide status updates via our support channel to any authorized customer that requests it.
* notify agency authorizing officials, customers, and community of the applicability update via our [public status service: https://cloudgov.statuspage.io](https://cloudgov.statuspage.io).
  * (posted as a "Resolved Incident" that impacts "cloud.gov compliance notification" (operational), with "Send Notification")

We will no longer be publicly providing our specific compliance status, as future directives could apply to components in the cloud.gov system.

cloud.gov confirms that it has zero affected endpoints in the FedRAMP authorized boundary, and hence has 100% patch compliance.

Further, cloud.gov has zero affected endpoints under our management outside the boundary, e.g. in development or test environments.

We want to assure cloud.gov agency customers that their systems, and our product, have no exposure to this particular vulnerability.
