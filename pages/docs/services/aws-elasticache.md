cloud.gov offers [aws-elasticache-redis](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) Redis as a service.

## Plans

Service Name | Plan Name | Description | Number of nodes |
------------ | --------- | ----------- | --------------- | -----
`aws-elasticache-redis` | `redis-dev` | Single EC node for non-prod use only | 1 |
`aws-elasticache-redis` | `redis-3node` | 3 node EC, persistent storage, 512Mb memory limit | 3 |
`aws-elasticache-redis` | `redis-5node` | 5 node EC, persistent storage, 512Mb memory limit | 5 |
`aws-elasticache-redis` | `redis-3node-large` | 3 node EC, persistent storage, 1.3GB memory limit | 3 |
`aws-elasticache-redis` | `redis-5node-large` | 5 node EC, persistent storage, 1.3GB memory limit | 5 |

## Pricing

$200/month per 10 nodes block. First 10 nodes included at no cost. More information on the [pricing page]({{ site.baseurl }}/_pages/pricing).

#### How to create an instance

To create a service instance, run the following command (replace `my-ec-service` with a name for the service):

```sh
cf create-service aws-elasticache-redis redis-3node my-ec-service
```
### Setting optional parameters

There are several optional parameters that you can specify when creating a new instance:

Name               | Description                                                    | Default Value          |
---                | ---                                                            | ---                    |
`engineVersion`    | Specifies a supported major version in Redis (must be in "")   | 6.2                    |

A couple of notes regarding the optional `version` parameter:

- It only supports major version numbers; if you specify a minor/patch level version, e.g., "6.2.1" , the command will fail with the exception of 5.0.6 which is a major version with a minor version release.
- The version number must be provided in double quotes (`"`); this is because the value is treated as a string to account for different versions.

These are the current supported major versions for Redis:

- 5.0.6
- 6.0
- 6.2
- 7.0 

#### Examples of optional parameters

If you want to specify the engine version:

```sh
cf create-service aws-elasticache-redis \
    ${SERVICE_PLAN_NAME} \
    ${SERVICE_NAME} \
    -c '{"engineVersion": "6.2"}'
```

## Managing backups

As part of the aws-elasticache-redis service, AWS will be doing daily snapshots of all EC instances between 06:00-07:00 UTC.  The service is configured to keep 3 snapshots.  If you need one of these automated snapshots restored, please email [cloud.gov support](mailto:support@cloud.gov).

For manual backups, the Elasticache service does not expose access to files generated by the Elasticache Redis [SAVE](https://redis.io/commands/save) command. To back up data from your Elasticache Redis instance, you can iterate over keys, fetch their values and expiration times using [DUMP](https://redis.io/commands/dump) and [TTL](https://redis.io/commands/ttl), and save them to a file. To restore, use the [RESTORE](https://redis.io/commands/restore) command for each saved key.

Please see [https://github.com/cloud-gov/aws-redis-example](https://github.com/cloud-gov/aws-redis-example) our AWS Elasticache Redis example repo for some ideas on moving data as well.

### Connecting to your Elasticache service locally

To facilitate backing up your Elasticache service, cloud.gov offers port forwarding if
SSH is enabled for your organization and application. Follow the following
instructions to create a service key and use it to set up a SSH tunnel.

Create a [service key](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/service-keys.html)
to access Elasticache credentials:

```sh
cf create-service-key my-elasticache my-key
```

Connect to your Elasticache service using port forwarding (see [Using SSH]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/management/using-ssh)). You'll need to
leave the `cf ssh` command running
and follow the next steps in a different terminal so that you can access the
remote Elasticache instance from your local environment. These steps assume you have [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed locally.

```sh
elasticache_credentials=$(cf service-key my-elasticache my-key | tail -n +3)

elasticache_hostname=$(echo "${elasticache_credentials}" | jq -r '.hostname')
elasticache_port=$(echo "${elasticache_credentials}" | jq -r '.port')
elasticache_password=$(echo "${elasticache_credentials}" | jq -r '.password')

cf ssh my-app -L "8000:${elasticache_hostname}:${elasticache_port}"
```

You can now connect to your Elasticache service from your local machine using port `8000` and the password set to `$elasticache_password`, e.g. using the latest version of [Redis CLI](https://redis.io/topics/rediscli):

```sh
redis-cli -a "${elasticache_password}" -p 8000 --tls
```

## Encryption

Every AWS Elasticache instance configured through cloud.gov is [encrypted at rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/at-rest-encryption.html). We use the industry standard AES-256 encryption algorithm to encrypt your data on the server that hosts your AWS Elasticache instance. 


## Rotating credentials

You can rotate credentials by creating a new instance and [deleting the existing instance](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/delete-service.html). If this is not an option, email [cloud.gov support](mailto:support@cloud.gov) to request rotating the credentials manually.
