You can store application content in S3 using a [managed service]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/deployment/managed-services) that provides direct access to S3.

## Plans

Plan Name | Description |
--------- | ----------- | -----
`basic`   | A single private bucket  |
`basic-public` | A single public bucket, where the files are **all public** to read |
`basic-sandbox` | Similar plan as `basic`, but bucket is deleted when `cf delete-service <SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME>` is executed |
`basic-public-sandbox` | Similar plan as `basic-public`, but bucket is deleted when `cf delete-service <SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME>` is executed |

*Additional Cost:* All buckets have a limit of 5TB in storage. After 5TB, each additional terabyte will cost $100 per month.

## How to create an instance

First decide if the S3 bucket contents should be private or public. Objects placed in a private bucket are only accessible using the bucket credentials unless specifically [shared with others](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html). Objects placed in a public bucket are accessible to anyone with the link.

To create a private bucket use the `basic` plan:

```sh
cf create-service s3 basic <SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME>
```

To create a public bucket use the `basic-public` plan:

```sh
cf create-service s3 basic-public <SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME>
```

### Setting optional parameters

These are the optional parameters that you can specify when creating a new bucket:

Name               | Description                                                    | Default Value          |
---                | ---                                                            | ---                    |
`object_ownership` | [The object ownership strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) to use for the bucket. Valid values: `ObjectWriter`, `BucketOwnerPreferred`, `BucketOwnerEnforced` | `ObjectWriter`

#### Examples of optional parameters

To create a bucket using the `BucketOwnerEnforced` object ownership:

```sh
cf create-service s3 basic \
  -c '{"object_ownership": "BucketOwnerEnforced"}'
```

## How to create an instance for your sandbox

Sandbox accounts can only create and bind to S3 sandbox plans.  Please be advised these S3 accounts are deleted along with your sandbox as part of our sandbox purge policy.  There are two plans available for your sandbox accounts: `basic-sandbox` AND `basic-public-sandbox`.  Follow the directions as above for creating S3 plans when instantiating these plans,
e.g for `basic-sandbox`:

```sh
cf create-service s3 basic-sandbox <SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME>
```

## More information

### Using S3 from your application

By default, when new spaces are created in your organization, an application security group (ASG) is applied that doesn't allow any outgoing traffic. You will need to [update egress traffic]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/management/space-egress) rules to allow for your app to reach the S3 bucket.

To make the bucket usable from your application, you must bind it:

```sh
cf bind-service <APP_NAME> <SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME>
cf restage <APP_NAME>
```

This will put the S3 access information in the application's [environment variables](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html). You can inspect these values with `cf env <APP_NAME>` if necessary.

If you get an error, see the [managed service documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/deployment/managed-services#paid-services).

If you need to access multiple S3 buckets using the same access credentials--for example, to copy files from one bucket to another--you can use the `additional_instances` option when binding:

```sh
cf bind-service <APP_NAME> \
    <SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME> \
    -c '{"additional_instances": ["<ADDITIONAL_SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME>"]}'
```

The credentials created for this binding will have access to both the bucket managed by `<SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME>` and `<ADDITIONAL_SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME>`, and the bucket managed by `<ADDITIONAL_SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME>` will be listed in the `additional_buckets` field of the credentials.

### Interacting with your S3 bucket from outside cloud.gov

You may want to use your S3 service as a repository for file transfer between humans, or for communicating content with other systems hosted outside of cloud.gov. You can manage credentials for accessing your S3 bucket using [service keys](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/service-keys.html). The service key details provide you with the credentials that are used with common file transfer programs by humans or configured in external systems. Typically you would create a unique service key for each external client of the bucket to make it easy to rotate credentials in case they are leaked.

You can create a service key by running `cf create-service-key <SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME> <KEY_NAME>`. (For example, to create a key for user Bob for the S3 bucket `mybucket`, you would run `cf create-service-key mybucket Bob`.) To later revoke access (eg when no longer required, or when compromised), you can run `cf delete-service-key <SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME> <KEY_NAME>`. To get the credentials from the service key, you can run `cf service-key <SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME> <KEY_NAME>`; you will see a JSON description of the credentials.

Clients will need the following information from this JSON description:

* `access_key_id`
* `secret_access_key`
* `region`
* `bucket`

Treat these values as sensitive!

To create a service key that can access multiple buckets, you can use the `additional_instances` option described above.

#### Using the S3 credentials

For interactive file transfer tools, you will usually see a dialog box or form that asks for the values above. You can just copy and paste them in.

For automated or CLI processes, you may want to use the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) tool to automate extraction of the necessary values from the service key.

For example, you might want to use the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) to add, modify, and download files in a bucket. The AWS CLI requires the values above as environment variables. If you are using Linux or Mac, this script file will set them for you:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Run this script with a . in order to set environment variables in your shell
# For example:
# . ./getcreds.sh

SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME=your-s3-service-instance-name-here
KEY_NAME=your-service-key-name-here

cf create-service-key "${SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME}" "${KEY_NAME}"
S3_CREDENTIALS=$(cf service-key "${SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME}" "${KEY_NAME}" | tail -n +2)

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(echo "${S3_CREDENTIALS}" | jq -r '.credentials.access_key_id')
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(echo "${S3_CREDENTIALS}" | jq -r '.credentials.secret_access_key')
export BUCKET_NAME=$(echo "${S3_CREDENTIALS}" | jq -r '.credentials.bucket')
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=$(echo "${S3_CREDENTIALS}" | jq -r '.credentials.region')
```

If you are running Windows on your local machine, you can find [instructions on how to set environmental variables using the Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-set).

This will set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` and `BUCKET_NAME` environment variables, enabling the AWS CLI tool to add, download and modify files as needed:

```sh
# Copy a file
aws s3 cp ./mylocalfile s3://${BUCKET_NAME}/

# Download a file
aws s3 cp s3://${BUCKET_NAME}/mys3file .

# See all files
aws s3 ls s3://${BUCKET_NAME}
```

For large database archives that won't fit on the instance's local disk, you can pipe directly to other commands using the usual `-` syntax.

```sh
aws s3 cp s3://${BUCKET_NAME}/db.sql - | psql
```

### Bucket URLs

Objects in your bucket can be accessed via the following endpoint:

* `https://s3-${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}.amazonaws.com/${BUCKET_NAME}/`

If you plan to enable "website mode" for the bucket and use it that way, you will need to use a different version of the URL:

* `http://${BUCKET_NAME}.s3-website-${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}.amazonaws.com/`

Note that "website mode" URLs don't support HTTPS, and they aren't appropriate for production use unless fronted by a CloudFront distribution.

Either way, if the bucket is private, attempting to access resources will result in `AccessDenied` errors unless your application generates [pre-signed URLs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html) for objects that need to be shared.

### Allowing client-side web access from external applications

By default, browsers only allow JavaScript to make HTTP requests to the same domain as the page serving the JavaScript, as part of the web's [Same Origin Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy). This means that by default, S3 buckets can only be accessed by JavaScript when that JavaScript is served directly from the same origin as the S3 bucket.

If an application wishes to allow client-side JavaScript in other applications to access its S3 buckets, this can be done by setting a [CORS policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS). CORS allows an origin to "opt in" to allowing its contents to be accessed by JavaScript in specified origins (or any origin) to access the bucket.

You can set a CORS policy restricting access to a specific list of sites and methods (such as the example below), or allow arbitrary origins (using `*`) to read bucket data:

```sh
# Adjust CORS AllowedOrigins to known locations such as a IP address
cat << EOF > cors.json
{
  "CORSRules": [
    {
      "AllowedOrigins": ["https://otherapp.hostname.gov", "https://anotherapp.hostname.com"],
      "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
      "AllowedMethods": ["HEAD", "GET"],
      "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"]
    }
  ]
}
EOF

### Upload the CORS policy to the bucket
aws s3api put-bucket-cors --bucket $BUCKET_NAME --cors-configuration file://cors.json
```

You can add additional method types along with HEAD and GET (such as PUT, POST, and DELETE) as needed.

### Backup and retention

By default, S3 data will stay where it is. You must [empty the bucket](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/delete-or-empty-bucket.html#empty-bucket-awscli) before `cf delete-service` can be run on the `<APP_NAME>-s3` service.  This however is not a substitute for backups, and it provides no protection from users accidentally deleting the contents.

For sandbox accounts if your sandbox is deleted automatically after 90 days, as per policy, the S3 service and all respective content stored within those S3 services will be cleared.  If you plan on storing important information in your sandbox S3 resources you must implement some type of backup scheme.

You can implement a backup scheme by storing your buckets under /data/year/month/day and keeping multiple copies in S3, using the AWS CLI. Your Org Manager can create a space called "backups", and your team can run the process above again to create backup buckets.

## Encryption

Every AWS S3 Bucket configured through cloud.gov is [encrypted at rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html). We use the industry standard AES-256 encryption algorithm to encrypt your data on the server that hosts your AWS S3 Bucket.

### Rotating credentials

The S3 service creates unique IAM credentials for each application binding or service key. To rotate credentials associated with an application binding, unbind and rebind the service instance to the application. To rotate credentials associated with a service key, [delete](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/service-keys.html#delete) and recreate the service key.
