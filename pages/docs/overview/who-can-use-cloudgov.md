cloud.gov is suitable for hosting applications built on behalf of a U.S. government organization.

Customers pay for cloud.gov through the federal Interagency Agreement (IAA/MOU) process (see [how to purchase]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/sign-up)). *U.S. local, state, tribal, or territory government organizations are not able to use cloud.gov at this time.*
 
You should have a technical person or people (employees and/or contractors) available who will manage your applications on cloud.gov. They should be capable of [evaluating your application for suitability to cloud.gov]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/overview/portfolio-analysis). They will need to be able to install the [cloud.gov command line interface]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/setup) (compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux) on their client workstation to interact with cloud.gov.
