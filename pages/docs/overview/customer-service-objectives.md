The **goal** of Service Objectives (SO) is to publicize our operating procedures and provide transparency about our operation of Cloud.gov. We publish our SOs in lieu of establishing a Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Our **objectives** are:

  - Present a clear and concise description of our service.
  - Provide clear reference to service ownership, accountability, roles and responsibilities.

Our program’s top **priorities** are:

  1. **Compliance** - Applications running on cloud.gov gain the inheritance model provided by FedRAMP JAB’s Moderate P-ATO. By focusing on FedRAMP compliance, we are ensuring all the applications on the platform remain compliant.
  1. **Safety & Security** - We maintain a large platform with many different applications. Tenant safety is of the utmost importance to ensure that all our customers are safe from interference and abuse.
  1. **Transparency** - We publish metrics and status updates about the platform as events happen. Our code base is open to the public and we provide customers visibility in our process.

Our **performance goals**:

  - We publicly publish real time metrics regarding platform availability at https://cloudgov.statuspage.io.
  - For incidents, we consider less than 90% availability over one hour as an incident (6 minute outage), less than 97% over a 24-hour period (43 minute outage)>
    - Our site is "unavailable" if more than 10% of public users are experiencing issues.

Our **support availability**:

  - Email support (Monday - Friday): 9:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time
  - Emails received outside of office hours will be prioritized the next business day.

Our **maintenance policy**:

  - We perform system maintenance and upgrades in the middle of the week (Tuesday to Thursday) to make sure all our staff are available during the maintenance window.

We **prioritize communication** in the following order:

  - For issues that impact platform availability: within 3 business hours.
  - For issues that impact provisioning services: within two business days.
  - For all other issues: within five business days.

For issues that impact the platform or services we will:

  - Log communication and coordination between the team to resolve the issue.
  - Hold a retrospective to analyze and report on follow-up items and lessons-learned.
  - For security incidents, we follow the process outlined in our [Incident Response]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/ops/security-ir/).
