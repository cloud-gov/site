title: Leveraging cloud.gov authentication
---

cloud.gov uses Cloud Foundry's [User Account and Authentication (UAA) server](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/uaa.html) to provide identity management capabilities for the cloud.gov platform.

App developers can leverage cloud.gov's UAA instance as a backend that brokers authentication with [supported identity providers]({{ site.baseurl }}/_docs/getting-started/accounts#get-access-to-cloudgov). You can use cloud.gov's authentication brokering if the users that you need to authenticate in your application are federal employees and contractors who can use those authentication methods.

This service handles only authentication, not authorization -- it's up to your application to manage what they can access within the application. Once you set it up, you can direct your users to the [list of ways to get cloud.gov access]({{ site.baseurl }}/_docs/getting-started/accounts#get-access-to-cloudgov); they don't need any org or space roles, they just need to be able to log into cloud.gov.

## Using cloud.gov authentication

### Register your application instances

You will first need to register all instances (such as dev, staging, and production) with cloud.gov's UAA. To register your instance, use the [cloud.gov identity provider]({{ site.baseurl }}/_docs/services/cloud-gov-identity-provider) service.

### Integrate with your application

UAA handles authentication according to the [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) specification, which is "a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol."

There are two important cloud.gov URLs you will need to use:

- `https://login.fr.cloud.gov/oauth/authorize`, which is where you will direct the user to login with their agency credentials
- `https://uaa.fr.cloud.gov/oauth/token`, which is where you will exchange auth codes for auth tokens

If you are already familiar with OAuth 2.0, you might know where to go from here. If not, read on for a basic example of how to do the OAuth dance.

#### Send your user to login.fr.cloud.gov

First, generate a link (or redirect the user) to the authorize URL with these
query parameters:

- `client_id=<CLIENT_ID>` (you can retrieve your `client_id` via `cf service-key`)
- `response_type=code`
- `redirect_uri=<A REGISTERED CALLBACK URL>` (required if you have multiple registered callback URLs)
- `state=<ANYTHING>` (optional)

You only need to provide `redirect_uri` if you have multiple registered callback URLs for a single
UAA registration (for instance, if you have both an "app.cloud.gov" URL and a production URL).
The value of `redirect_uri` must match one of the callback URLs registered in your service key.

You can set a `state` parameter with any value you'd like.
It will be returned to you in a later step. While optional, we *strongly*
recommend that you use it with a high-quality random number or a hash generated with a secret key, because it [protects against cross-site request forgery attacks](http://www.thread-safe.com/2014/05/the-correct-use-of-state-parameter-in.html).

Here is an example:

```html
<a href="https://login.fr.cloud.gov/oauth/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&state=9ab894ad91d99eb9ee4b30ea7f02b9d8e43eb15db58ff93e4894f3b49817d7ab">
  Log in
</a>
```

Once the user clicks on this link, they will be sent to cloud.gov to login.

#### The user is returned to your site

Once the user successfully logs in with their credentials, your app will
receive a `GET` request to the callback URL associated with the registered
app. The `GET` request will include query parameters:

- `code=<A UNIQUE ACCESS CODE>`
- (optional) `state=<VALUE FROM STATE PARAM IN AUTHORIZE LINK>`

Now your site's backend will need to exchange the access code for an
access token. Here is where things get fun.

1. First, exchange the `code` for an authorization token by sending a
  `POST` request to the token endpoint
  (`https://uaa.fr.cloud.gov/oauth/token`) with the following form-encoded
  parameters:

    - `code=<CODE FROM QUERY PARAM IN CALLBACK REQUEST>`
    - `grant_type=authorization_code`
    - `response_type=token`
    - `client_id=<CLIENT_ID>` (you can retrieve your `client_id` via `cf service-key`)
    - `client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>` (you can retrieve your `client_secret` via `cf service-key`)
    - `redirect_uri=<A REGISTERED CALLBACK URL>` (required if you have multiple registered callback URLs)

2. If everything works and UAA is able to verify your request, the response
  from that `POST` request will be JSON encoded and will contain these
  important members:

    - `access_token` - a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/)
    - `expires_in` - time in seconds until the `access_token` expires
    - `refresh_token` - a refresh token that can be exchanged for another
      `access_token` when the current one expires

3. The `access_token` is a JSON Web Token that can be decoded using a
  library such as [node-jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken).
  See <https://jwt.io/> for a list of libraries for various languages.
  
  Verify the token's signature using cloud.gov's JWK Set and the RSA256 alogrithm. This step ensures the
  token is authentic. The JWK Set for cloud.gov's UAA is located at `https://uaa.fr.cloud.gov/token_keys`.
  
  Decode the token to get the authenticated user's `email`, which you can then use within
  your application to identify and/or authorize the user.

  If you get an expired token error at some point in the future, you can
  exchange the `refresh_token` from the previous step to get a new `access_token`,
  so you might want to securely save the `refresh_token` associated with the
  authenticated user.

#### Logging users out of UAA and your application

cloud.gov's UAA server provides a logout endpoint to terminate the user session.
To implement this logout:

- Provide a local logout feature specific to your application and use that to
  clear state in your application.
- On success for that logout, redirect to the UAA server logout endpoint.
- Provide a `redirect` link and the `client_id` for your application so that
  users come back to a familiar place when logged out.

Include the `redirect` link when you register your [cloud.gov identity
provider]({{ site.baseurl }}/_docs/services/cloud-gov-identity-provider)
service. It's common for this redirect link to be your application's URL with a
path of `/logout`.

The full URL parameters and constraints are in the [latest UAA API
documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/) under **Session
Management** > **Logout.do**.

## Managing UAA access

If you (or a user of your app) ever need to modify or revoke the permissions of
third-party applications that you've granted access through the cloud.gov UAA,
visit [https://login.fr.cloud.gov/profile](https://login.fr.cloud.gov/profile).

## Using a development UAA server

During development, you may want to authenticate against a local UAA server
so you can test as multiple users, skip 2-factor authentication,
and view UAA logs. Running UAA in [Docker](https://www.docker.com) can simplify this,
and you can follow an example of this in the [cloud.gov demonstrations repository](https://github.com/18F/cg-demos/blob/master/cg-identity/README.md#2-run-a-local-uaa-server-for-local-development).

## Demonstrating the cloud.gov identity provider

You can go through the process of setting up a simple application, written in Node.js, to use the cloud.gov identity provider in the [cloud.gov demonstrations repository](https://github.com/18F/cg-demos/blob/master/cg-identity/README.md#1-run-an-application-in-cloudgov-that-uses-the-identity-provider).
